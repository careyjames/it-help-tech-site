## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you help with PC, Linux, or mixed computer environments?
Yes. Our primary expertise is macOS and iOS, including secure remote troubleshooting (including iPhone/iPad screen sharing when appropriate). We also support Windows and Linux in mixed environments, especially where identity, networking, and email deliverability overlap.

### How is your service different from a Managed Service Provider (MSP)?
We focus on transparent, on-demand help instead of locking clients into monthly fees. No long-term contracts or retainers—just clear billing for actual work performed. The incentive is to solve problems efficiently, not pad hours.

### Do you fix cracked iPhone screens?
No. We are not a hardware repair shop—we specialize in operating systems, software, networking, and data security. For existing clients, we can do a concierge replacement: pick up a factory-fresh iPhone from Apple and migrate your data on-site while you watch. Prefer glass replacement? We can refer you to a vetted local technician.

### Do you provide same-day service in La Jolla?
Yes—schedule permitting. For most Mac, Wi‑Fi, or email issues we can often dispatch to La Jolla the same day.

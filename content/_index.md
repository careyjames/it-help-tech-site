## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you help with PC, Linux, or mixed computer environments?
Absolutely! Our primary expertise lies with **macOS and iOS support**, and we excel at troubleshooting for these platforms, including **secure screen sharing directly with iPhones and iPads**. We also possess a deep understanding of Linux and Windows systems, enabling us to support a diverse range of technical environments effectively.  

### How is your service different from a Managed Service Provider (MSP)?
We take a different approach focused on transparency and on-demand support. Unlike many MSPs that lock clients into fixed monthly fees regardless of usage, **we believe you should only pay for IT help when needed.** There are no long-term contracts or arbitrary retainers with us – just fair, transparent billing for actual work performed. Think of it as having an elite IT team on call: we can essentially become part of your team on an as-needed basis. This flexible model saves you money and builds trust. Our goal is to resolve issues efficiently and effectively. We offer high-touch, on-demand IT support as an ethical alternative to the traditional MSP model.

### Do you fix cracked iPhone screens?

**No, we’re not a hardware repair shop.** We specialize in operating systems, software, networking, and data security. For existing clients with a cracked screen, **we offer a concierge replacement:** we pick up a factory-fresh iPhone from Apple, meet you on-site, and migrate your data while you watch. Your phone never leaves your side, so your contacts and sensitive info stay shielded from prying eyes. Prefer a glass replacement? We’ll refer you to a vetted local technician.

## Custom Solutions That Work for You  

Our premium, concierge-level on-site service is designed for individuals, executives, business owners, and anyone who values precision, discretion, and results. With over 25 years of experience supporting high-profile clients in the entertainment, legal, restaurant, and medical fields, we bring the technical depth and professionalism to solve your problem correctly the first time. We listen closely and implement solutions that are proven to work effectively, tailored to your specific needs.

## Core Expertise

We can tackle a vast array of IT challenges and are highly comfortable using the terminal and the command line.  
Our key areas of deep expertise include:

### Network Infrastructure & WiFi Troubleshooting

Spend more time at the beach, not fighting your WiFi.

Specializing in large luxury homes and offices with extensive networking and WiFi needs.
We design and implement bespoke high-performance WiFi networks for large La Jolla estates, modern Del Mar residences, and smart homes throughout San Diego. Leveraging science-based methodologies and enterprise-grade infrastructure, including Cat6A, Cat8, and fiber backbones, we ensure flawless, secure, and ultra-fast connectivity that supports demanding applications, extensive smart home integrations, and the high-bandwidth needs of creative professionals and executive home offices. Say goodbye to dead zones and unreliable connections.
We use science-based methods to solve problems and design networks. We show you options for WiFi gear that can achieve the speeds you want, and you can buy directly from the source, not from us. We don’t depend upon a 40% markup for survival, and we are not limited to lower-spec gear.
This allows us to be free from the distribution channels that most IT/AV companies are locked into, enabling us to demonstrate to you, using scientific specifications, why you may want specific products.
We architect secure, robust networks that seamlessly integrate advanced technologies with precision and clarity, so you get fast WiFi.
(at the speed you're paying for) everywhere in your location.

### Cybersecurity & Ethical Screen Sharing
We provide robust Mac defenses against viruses, Email phishing, browser blocks, and more, providing powerful tools to reduce risks and enhance your digital security. We can help secure your endpoints (macOS, Windows, Linux) and advise on best practices for mobile device security.
* **Ethical Screen Sharing:** We adhere to the highest ethical standards. For all screen-sharing sessions, **you, the client, always initiate and approve access**. We never access your systems “behind your back."

### How is your service different from a Managed Service Provider (MSP)?
We take a different approach focused on transparency and on-demand support.

Your phone never leaves your hands, so your contacts and sensitive info stay shielded from prying eyes. Prefer a glass replacement? We’ll refer you to a vetted local technician.

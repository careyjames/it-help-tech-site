If you believe you found a security issue in systems operated by IT Help San Diego Inc., please report it responsibly.

## Contact

- Email: `security@it-help.tech`

If you need a different secure reporting channel, request one in your initial email.

## What To Include

Please include enough detail for reliable triage:

- Exact URL(s), endpoint(s), or component(s) affected.
- Reproduction steps and any prerequisites.
- Proof of concept, logs, or screenshots (when safe to share).
- Your contact information for follow-up.

## Scope

This policy applies to internet-facing assets owned and operated by IT Help San Diego Inc. for `it-help.tech`.

If you report an issue in third-party infrastructure, include evidence showing how it directly affects our operated assets.

## Safe Harbor

If you act in good faith and follow this policy, we will treat your research as authorized and will not pursue legal action for your report.

Good-faith testing means:

- Avoiding privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption.
- Accessing only the minimum data required to demonstrate the issue.
- Stopping testing after obtaining proof and reporting promptly.
- Not sharing, retaining, or reusing any non-public data.

## Out Of Scope

The following are generally out of scope unless there is demonstrable business impact:

- Social engineering or phishing attempts against staff/customers.
- Physical attacks or local network attacks requiring physical access.
- Denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS), traffic flooding, or resource exhaustion testing.
- Vulnerabilities that depend on outdated/unpatched client software.
- Reports without reproducible evidence.

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgment: within 3 business days.
- Triage/status update: typically within 10 business days.
- Remediation timeline: risk-based and dependent on complexity.

## Public Disclosure

Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until remediation is complete or a coordinated timeline is agreed upon in writing.

## Bug Bounty

IT Help San Diego Inc. does not currently operate a paid bug bounty program.

## TL;DR

Apple's built-in stack on a current Mac is genuinely good. **XProtect** (signature scan), **XProtect Remediator** (background remediation), **Gatekeeper** (code-signing enforcement), and **Notarization** (Apple-side malware scan of every distributed binary) together stop the overwhelming majority of commodity malware before it ever touches user data [^1]. The myth that Macs are immune is wrong; the inverted myth that Apple ships a defenseless OS is also wrong.

The single highest-leverage *free* thing you can add is **LuLu** by Patrick Wardle — outbound-network-connection visibility that Apple does not ship and that costs nothing [^6][^7]. After that, **Malwarebytes** is a fine consumer-grade anti-malware layer if you want one [^9]. That stack — **Apple's defaults left on, plus LuLu, plus optionally Malwarebytes** — already puts you ahead of most Mac users you know. You do not need to buy anything else to be meaningfully safer than you are right now.

If you would rather have all of this maintained for you on a per-device monthly basis, that is what our [Managed Agent](/managed-agent/) page covers — read it once, decide, and move on. The point of *this* article is that the cheap, do-it-yourself version is already most of the protection.

For iPhone: turn on **Stolen Device Protection** today [^10]. Reserve **Lockdown Mode** for the elevated-threat windows it is actually built for [^11].

## Mac Security Is Not Mac Immunity

Mac computers are well-defended. They are not immune. The "Macs don't get viruses" claim was always marketing rather than engineering, and Apple itself stopped making it years ago. What is true is that the macOS architecture — code signing required by default, sandboxed App Store apps, System Integrity Protection (SIP) restricting even root from modifying system locations, hardware-rooted boot trust on Apple Silicon, and the XProtect family running quietly in the background — raises the cost of a successful attack substantially compared to a default Windows install [^1].

That higher cost shapes the threat landscape in a useful way. Commodity criminal malware that targets Windows-style user habits (run an attachment, install a "video codec," click through a UAC prompt) mostly bounces off macOS for purely structural reasons. What gets through is narrower and more deliberate: targeted exploits, adware and potentially-unwanted programs (PUPs) that side-step malware definitions on a technicality, and social engineering that bypasses every technical control by attacking the user.

### What Apple's built-in stack actually does

The Apple Platform Security Guide is the primary source for the layered defenses macOS ships with [^1]. The pieces relevant to malware specifically:

- **XProtect** — signature-based malware detection that runs at file-open and quarantine-evaluation time. Apple updates the signatures out-of-band, independent of OS releases.
- **XProtect Remediator** — a background process that periodically scans the system for known malware families and removes them when found, without waiting for the user to trigger a scan.
- **Gatekeeper** — verifies that downloaded software is signed by a registered Apple Developer ID and (for App Store and notarized apps) has been notarized.
- **Notarization** — Apple's automated server-side scan of every distributed binary submitted by developers; binaries that fail Notarization will be blocked by Gatekeeper on user machines.
- **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** — even with `sudo`, a process cannot modify protected system locations.
- **App Sandbox + hardened runtime** — apps that opt in (and all App Store apps must) operate inside an OS-enforced sandbox restricting what files, hardware, and network endpoints they can touch.

This is a serious, layered set of controls. It is also exactly that — a *set* of controls aimed at *known* threats. None of it stops a zero-day before its signature lands, none of it stops a *signed-and-notarized* application from later doing something the user did not anticipate, and none of it provides outbound-network-connection visibility, which is where most useful insight into "what is this Mac actually doing right now" lives.

## What Actually Gets Past the Defaults

### Targeted exploit chains and state-grade spyware

The most rigorously documented case of an Apple platform being broken by a real adversary in production is **FORCEDENTRY** (**CVE-2021-30860**), an iMessage zero-click exploit chain attributed to NSO Group's Pegasus toolkit, reverse-engineered and disclosed by The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto in September 2021 [^2][^3]. The chain exploited an integer overflow in CoreGraphics' processing of malicious PDF content delivered via iMessage — no user interaction required — and was used in the wild against journalists and activists. Apple shipped a fix in iOS 14.8, iPadOS 14.8, macOS 11.6, and watchOS 7.6.2 within days of the disclosure.

The takeaway is not that everyone is a Pegasus target — most people are not. It is that the operational pattern (zero-click delivery, memory-safety bug in a privileged parser, immediate full-device compromise) is real, has been documented end-to-end with primary-source forensics, and is the *actual* upper bound on what a determined nation-state-grade adversary can do to a current Apple device. Anyone telling you Macs and iPhones cannot be compromised has not read the Citizen Lab report. Anyone telling you they will be compromised on Tuesday by a generic ransomware crew is also wrong.

### Adware, PUPs, and "valid" software that misbehaves

Malwarebytes' annual *State of Malware* reports have, for several years, found that Macs see a higher *count* of detected threats than Windows endpoints in their telemetry — but with the important caveat that the bulk of that count is **adware and PUPs**, not destructive malware [^9]. Adware and PUPs frequently arrive as bundled installers — software the user did intentionally install, whose installer also drops a browser hijacker, an "optimizer," or a search redirect. These programs are often signed and notarized (Apple's process scans for *malware*, not *bad software-design choices*), so Gatekeeper and XProtect have nothing to flag.

This is the realistic everyday Mac threat: not Pegasus, but the slow accretion of low-quality signed software that is technically "valid" yet is reading data, pushing ads, and phoning home in ways the user never authorized. Defending against this requires *visibility into the outbound network connections each application is opening* — which is exactly what LuLu provides, and exactly what Apple's built-in stack does not.

### WebKit memory-corruption RCEs

Beyond the FORCEDENTRY chain, multiple in-the-wild WebKit vulnerabilities have been used in targeted Safari attacks. **CVE-2021-30858** (a use-after-free in WebKit) [^4] and **CVE-2021-30632** (a JIT type-confusion bug) [^5] were both exploited in the wild and patched in 2021 emergency updates. Disabling JIT compilation in Safari is exactly what **Lockdown Mode** does for a reason: removing the JIT removes the most commonly exploited optimization surface in modern browser engines.

### Social engineering

No technical control fully defends against a user being persuaded to type their password into a convincing fake. macOS user-experience defenses help (the security-context prompts, the credential-dialog isolation, password autofill that refuses to fill on the wrong domain), but social engineering remains the single most common successful initial-access vector across all platforms [^12].

## Threat Model

Before recommending anything, it is worth being explicit about the adversary classes a typical Mac is actually defending against.

| Adversary tier | Capability | Defense that breaks them |
|---|---|---|
| Commodity criminal mass attacks | Phishing payloads, bundled installers, browser hijackers, generic ransomware crews | Apple defaults (Gatekeeper, XProtect, Notarization) + outbound-egress visibility (LuLu) + user awareness |
| Targeted intrusion (small organization scale) | Spear-phish, credential-stuffing, abuse of legitimately-signed administrative tools, lateral movement | Above plus a managed endpoint-security agent, plus email controls (DMARC/MTA-STS — see [DNS Security Best Practices](/field-notes/dns-security-best-practices/)) |
| State-grade actors (Pegasus class) | Zero-click memory-corruption chains, paid 0-day, targeted message-app delivery | Patched OS within hours of CVE disclosure, **Lockdown Mode** for elevated risk windows, threat-intel partnerships |

The cheap, do-it-yourself stack below covers tier 1 cleanly and a substantial fraction of tier 2. Tier 3 requires accepting some user-experience cost (Lockdown Mode) and accepting that no civilian-tier configuration eliminates the risk — only reduces the window.

## What You Should Actually Do (Cheapest First)

This is the practical part of the article. Read it as a stepladder. Most people stop at step 2 and are dramatically better off than they were yesterday.

### 1. Leave Apple's defaults on. Patch fast.

Don't disable Gatekeeper. Don't disable SIP. Don't override Notarization for one-off installs unless you can articulate exactly why. Apple's defaults are the floor and they are working harder than most people credit. Then keep the OS patched aggressively — the FORCEDENTRY response was a same-week patch, and same-week patching is the single highest-leverage thing a user can do to keep state-grade exploits closed.

**Cost:** $0. **Time:** a few minutes per OS update.

### 2. Install LuLu. (Free, GPLv3, Patrick Wardle.)

If you do nothing else from this article, do this one.

**LuLu** is a free, open-source, host-based application firewall for macOS [^6]. It is licensed under **GPLv3** [^7] and developed by **Patrick Wardle**, a former NSA security researcher [^8] who founded the **Objective-See Foundation** to ship the defensive macOS tools Apple does not. What LuLu does, mechanically, is straightforward and exactly what Apple has not built into the OS: it intercepts outbound network connections from each application and prompts you to allow or deny them, then remembers the decision. It does not require a paid subscription. It does not phone home. The source code is on GitHub for anyone to audit.

What this gives you in practice:

- **Visibility into "valid" software misbehaving.** A signed and notarized app that suddenly starts beaconing to an analytics endpoint shows up immediately. PUPs and adware that survived Gatekeeper because they were technically "valid" cannot exfiltrate without being asked.
- **Defense in depth against post-compromise exfiltration.** Even if an attacker lands code on your Mac, they cannot quietly exfiltrate to their own infrastructure if every new outbound destination triggers a prompt.
- **AI / local-LLM use case.** If you run local language models (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, etc.) and want to verify that the model and its host process are not making network calls, LuLu is the cleanest tool to enforce that. Allow only what you intend to allow; the rest never leaves the machine.

**How to install, end to end:**

1. Download from [objective-see.org/products/lulu.html](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html). Verify the package is signed by **Objective-See, LLC** in the macOS installer dialog before proceeding.
2. On first launch, grant the system-extension permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security. macOS prompts exactly once.
3. For the first few days you will see a stream of prompts as your existing apps make network connections. This is the system working as intended. Allow what you recognize (your browser, your mail client, your IDE, etc.). Deny what you don't.
4. Any decision can be revisited later in LuLu's preferences. There is no penalty for guessing.
5. After the initial learning period the prompts become rare. New prompts then become signal — that is the point.

A note on the historical alternative: in the older Mac-IT literature you will see references to **Little Snitch** by Objective Development. Little Snitch is alive, fully maintained, and a fine commercial product. The reason this article recommends LuLu rather than Little Snitch is that LuLu is free under GPLv3, so cost never blocks deploying it on every Mac you own. If you already use Little Snitch and are comfortable with it, leave it; otherwise, install LuLu.

**Cost:** $0. **Time:** 15 minutes to install, a few days of light decision-making to train.

### 3. Optional: Malwarebytes for the familiar anti-malware layer.

If you want a consumer-friendly anti-malware layer on top of Apple's defaults — the kind your CFO or your relatives expect to see installed — **Malwarebytes** is a fine choice [^9]. Their annual *State of Malware* reports are the data source for the "Macs do see threats, just mostly adware/PUPs" claim above; the company knows the Mac threat landscape because it is the one measuring it.

A free tier exists; the paid Premium product is in the low-tens-of-dollars-per-year range. It is not a substitute for the layers above; it is an additive baseline that catches the kind of nuisanceware that signature-based detection still does well against.

**Cost:** free or low. **Time:** trivial.

That is the cheap stack. **Apple defaults + LuLu + (optionally) Malwarebytes.** If you do nothing else for the rest of the year, you are already ahead of most Mac users you know.

### 4. If you want it managed for you.

If you would rather have someone else maintain the OS patching cadence, the security policy, FileVault key escrow, and the endpoint alerts on a per-device monthly fee — without an MSP retainer — that is what our [Managed Agent](/managed-agent/) page documents. The platform underneath is **ManageEngine Endpoint Central — Security Edition**, deployed on a per-client basis. Read the page for the full scope, the billing boundary, and what is and is not included; the math is shown before enrollment so you can decide on the merits.

You do not need this to be safer than most people. You might want it because you would rather not think about it.

### 5. If you are genuinely enterprise-class.

For organizations with the budget, the staffing, and the threat exposure to justify it, **SentinelOne Singularity** and **CrowdStrike Falcon** are both excellent endpoint detection and response platforms with strong macOS support. Both are deployed across Fortune 500s, financial institutions, and government agencies. The honest caveat is operational: enterprise EDR is high-maintenance. You need someone who reads the alerts, tunes the policies, and responds to the detections. Buying enterprise EDR and not staffing it produces the worst outcome — alerts no one acts on. For most San Diego small-to-mid clients the layers above are the right answer; if you are in the small fraction for whom they are not, you already know.

For organizations with a federal-posture mobile requirement specifically (active DoD contracts, FedRAMP scope, devices on the DHS Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Approved Products List), **Zimperium Mobile Threat Defense** is the right call and we will happily set up the portal. For everyone else, the rest of this article is enough.

## iPhone

iPhone is a different threat model than Mac and the right defenses are different.

### Stolen Device Protection (iOS 17.3+)

Apple introduced **Stolen Device Protection** in iOS 17.3 (January 2024). It addresses a specific, common, and previously-unsolved attack: a thief who shoulder-surfs the device passcode and then steals the unlocked phone. With Stolen Device Protection on, sensitive actions away from a familiar location require Face ID or Touch ID with no passcode fallback, and high-impact actions (such as changing the Apple ID password) require a one-hour security delay followed by a second biometric scan [^10].

This is high value, low friction. **Turn it on for every iPhone you own.** The setting lives under Settings → Face ID & Passcode → Stolen Device Protection.

### Lockdown Mode (iOS 16+)

**Lockdown Mode** is Apple's hardened operating mode, introduced in iOS 16 / iPadOS 16 / macOS Ventura. When enabled, it imposes a deliberate, exhaustive set of restrictions designed to remove the attack surface that mercenary spyware (Pegasus-class) actually uses [^11]:

- Most message attachments are blocked except for certain images, video, and audio. Links and link previews are disabled.
- Web technologies including JIT JavaScript compilation are disabled in Safari unless the user explicitly excludes a site.
- Incoming Apple service invitations (FaceTime calls and the like) from unknown senders are blocked.
- Shared Albums are removed from Photos and new shared-album invitations are blocked.
- Wired connections with accessories or other computers are blocked while the device is locked.
- Configuration profiles cannot be installed and the device cannot enroll into Mobile Device Management.

This is *real* protection. It is also exactly as restrictive as that list reads. **Honest disclosure:** most public-facing professionals — entertainers, executives, anyone whose phone is part of their working life — will not tolerate Lockdown Mode as a permanent setting. The blocked link previews alone are a productivity tax most of them will reject within a day. Lockdown Mode belongs in a specific set of cases:

- Travel into an elevated-threat jurisdiction.
- Named persecution targets (journalists, activists, dissidents, public officials in transition).
- Anyone who has *already* been compromised once and is being re-onboarded onto a new device.
- The specific period when an active threat is known.

For the everyday Mac and iPhone user who would simply like their device to be sensible: keep iOS patched aggressively, turn on Stolen Device Protection, use an iCloud account with a strong unique password and a hardware security key, and reserve Lockdown Mode for the moments it is genuinely warranted.

## Email Protection (Cross-Reference)

Most "Mac got hacked" stories are actually "Mac user got phished" stories. The defensible solution is to fix the email side first. The full guidance is in our companion field note on [DNS Security Best Practices](/field-notes/dns-security-best-practices/), which covers SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MTA-STS, TLS-RPT, DANE, and DNSSEC end to end with primary-source citations to the relevant IETF RFCs. For the Mac article, the short version is:

- Configure **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC `p=reject`** on every domain you send from.
- Add **MTA-STS and TLS-RPT** so transport between mail servers is encrypted with policy enforcement.
- Put a defensive pre-filter (**Proofpoint** or **Perception Point**) ahead of Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 if budget and risk profile justify it.

---

## Bottom Line

Apple's stack on a current Mac is genuinely good. The single highest-impact thing you can add — for free — is **LuLu**. After that, **Malwarebytes** if you want a familiar anti-malware layer. That puts you ahead of most Mac users you know, full stop. For iPhone, **Stolen Device Protection** is on by default in some iOS setups but not all; verify it is on for every device you own, and reserve **Lockdown Mode** for the moments it is genuinely needed.

If you want any of this maintained for you on a transparent per-device fee, that is what the [Managed Agent](/managed-agent/) page is for — read the math before enrolling in any managed service, including ours.

If you have questions, the first ten minutes of a call are no-charge per the [billing policy](/billing/) — long enough to figure out whether you actually need a senior person at all. Phone: **619-853-5008**. Or [schedule a consultation](https://schedule.it-help.tech/).

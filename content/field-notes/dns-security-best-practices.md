This guide explains how to configure and verify DNS email security controls so you can reduce spoofing, phishing, and business email compromise risk with defensible evidence — citing the IETF RFCs and federal guidance each control derives from.

### TL;DR
Email-authentication failures are rarely failures of *missing* records. They are failures of misinterpreting what the records actually enforce. The robust modern configuration for an active sending domain is **SPF `~all` + DKIM (2048-bit) + DMARC `p=reject`**, layered with **MTA-STS, TLS-RPT, and DANE** at the transport tier and **DNSSEC** beneath. Each control is defined by a specific IETF RFC, and the most common operational error — using SPF `-all` "for safety" — is explicitly warned against in RFC 7489 §10.1 because it can short-circuit DMARC. The sections below walk through what each control actually does, what threat it actually defends against, and how to validate behavior rather than just record presence.

## The Challenge: Ensuring DNS Security and Combating Email Vulnerabilities

Your Domain Name System (DNS) security protocols, such as DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) [^1], SPF (Sender Policy Framework) [^2], and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) [^3], are crucial for safeguarding your business against email vulnerabilities.

## Why DNS Security Matters

Without proper DNS security and email authentication, your business is susceptible to email spoofing and phishing attacks. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, financial loss, and a tarnished domain reputation. Adequately configured DNS records not only secure email but also improve deliverability. Emails from properly authenticated domains are less likely to be marked as spam, thus improving overall deliverability rates. Federal guidance on trustworthy email — NIST SP 800-177 Rev. 1 — codifies the same protocol stack as the practical baseline for any organization sending business email [^4].

## Threat Model: What These Controls Actually Defend Against

It is worth being precise about which attack each control addresses, because the answer is not "all of email security" — it is a specific, well-documented set of vectors.

- **Direct-domain spoofing.** An attacker sends mail using your exact `From:` domain (`ceo@yourcompany.com`). SPF + DKIM + DMARC are the only layer that defeats this at the protocol level. DMARC `p=reject` instructs receivers to refuse messages that fail alignment.
- **Lookalike-domain impersonation.** An attacker registers `yourcompany-invoices.com` or `your-company.com`. Email authentication does *not* defend against this — those messages pass authentication for a different domain. This is what CT log monitoring, brand-protection services, and user training defend against. Naming the gap honestly is part of the work.
- **Mail-in-transit interception and downgrade.** An attacker on the network path between sending and receiving mail servers attempts to read or modify the message, or to force a downgrade to plaintext SMTP. This is what **MTA-STS** [^5], **TLS-RPT** [^6], and **DANE for SMTP** [^7] address at the transport tier.
- **DNS-response forgery.** An attacker injects forged DNS responses to redirect mail flow or impersonate signing keys. This is what **DNSSEC** [^8] addresses by cryptographically signing DNS responses.
- **Account takeover.** An attacker logs into a legitimate account and sends mail through your real infrastructure. Authentication will pass — because the mail *is* authentic, just sent by the wrong person. This is what MFA, conditional access, and session-binding controls defend against, not DMARC.

The scale of the underlying problem is documented. The FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) recorded 880,418 complaints and over $12.5 billion in reported losses in calendar year 2023, with California consistently among the most-affected states [^9]. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report continues to identify pretexting and business email compromise as a dominant social-engineering pattern in confirmed breaches [^10]. The point of this section is not to manufacture urgency; it is to scope honestly which losses the controls below can plausibly reduce, and which they cannot.

## How to set up DMARC, SPF, and DKIM for Optimal DNS Security

DMARC, SPF, and DKIM offer a robust defense for your email system by authenticating the messages sent from your domain and providing a policy for handling messages that fail authentication. DMARC itself doesn't "authenticate messages" but rather uses SPF/DKIM results to decide enforcement.

## Sample DMARC, SPF, and DKIM Records: Key Elements of DNS Security


Here is a DNS Tool record snapshot from CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), the U.S. cybersecurity agency:

<img
  src="/images/cisa-dns.png"
  alt="DNS Tool record showing CISA DMARC, SPF, and DKIM enforcement"
  style="width: 520px !important; max-width: 100% !important; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async">



Notice that their policy is set to reject unauthorized messages.

We participate as a stakeholder in CISA's Cyber Hygiene program and continue to apply those operational lessons to real-world DNS and email security work.

## Common SPF Misconceptions

Contrary to some misunderstandings, the `-all` tag in an SPF record does not prevent internal users from sending or receiving email. Instead, it mandates that only explicitly authorized sources are allowed to send email on behalf of the domain. If a service is not listed in the SPF record, mail it sends claiming to be from your domain will fail SPF.

This is why third‑party services such as Mailchimp, Zendesk, CRMs, ticketing systems, and invoicing platforms must be explicitly allowed using `include:` mechanisms. Without those entries, their messages will fail SPF regardless of whether the mail itself is legitimate.

Where confusion arises is enforcement. SPF `-all` (hard fail) is often assumed to be "more secure," but RFC 7489 §10.1 explicitly warns that hard fail can cause receiving servers to reject messages before DKIM is evaluated and before DMARC can make a policy decision [^1].

This creates a failure mode where a message that fails SPF but would otherwise pass DMARC via DKIM alignment is rejected prematurely. In effect, SPF `-all` can short‑circuit DMARC, undermining the protocol designed to make final disposition decisions.

SPF was designed as an authorization signal, not a standalone enforcement mechanism. DMARC is the layer that evaluates SPF and DKIM together and applies policy (`p=none`, `quarantine`, or `reject`). Any configuration that prevents DMARC evaluation reduces overall security and breaks standards‑compliant mail flow.


## Modern Best Practice vs Legacy Guidance

For active sending domains, the strongest standards-compliant configuration is:

- SPF with `~all` (soft fail) [^2]
- DKIM properly deployed and aligned [^3]
- DMARC set to `p=reject` [^1]

This combination ensures that all authentication mechanisms are fully evaluated before a final decision is made. DMARC alignment, not raw SPF or DKIM pass/fail alone, is what ultimately determines message acceptance. SPF `~all` allows DKIM to run, and DMARC acts as the sole enforcement layer, as intended by the protocol design.

Some guidance, including older federal and enterprise deployments, historically favored SPF `-all` as a defense-in-depth measure. This was largely pragmatic: in 2017, when CISA Binding Operational Directive 18-01 was issued [^11], most domains had not yet deployed DMARC, and SPF hard fail acted as a coarse enforcement mechanism.

Today, DMARC `p=reject` is widely deployed across federal and commercial domains, and DKIM is widely relied upon for message authentication. As of February 2024, Google's email sender guidelines require SPF, DKIM, and an enforced DMARC policy for any sender delivering more than approximately 5,000 messages per day to personal Gmail accounts; Yahoo announced parallel sender requirements that made the same trio effectively mandatory for high-volume mail to Yahoo Mail users, with somewhat different operational framing [^12]. In this modern context, SPF `-all` becomes redundant and introduces the RFC 7489 §10.1 risk of premature rejection. Federal infrastructure often tolerates this due to tightly controlled sending paths, but that model does not generalize to commercial, multi-vendor, or cloud-based email environments.

Major mailbox providers now treat DMARC as the authoritative enforcement signal. The combination of SPF `~all` with DMARC `p=reject` provides stronger, more reliable protection than SPF hard fail alone, while remaining fully compatible with modern email authentication flows.

This guidance applies to active sending domains; parked or non-sending domains may safely use SPF `-all`. For non-sending domains, NIST SP 800-177 Rev. 1 and the IETF have long recommended a *null* SPF (`v=spf1 -all`) and DMARC `p=reject` to make the domain unforgeable for mail purposes [^4][^1].

The IETF DMARC working group has been finalizing a revision of RFC 7489, commonly referred to as DMARCbis, which modernizes the protocol — including a more explicit treatment of policy discovery via an organizational-domain boundary independent of the Public Suffix List. Whether the revision has been published as a successor RFC at the time you are reading this or remains in late-stage draft, the working group page is the canonical place to check current status, and operators planning new deployments should design for forward compatibility [^13].

## Practical Tools for DNS Security

This workflow is tool-agnostic. Use any standards-aware DNS/email auditor, then validate with live delivery testing.

- For a fast baseline and re-check after each change, **<a href="https://dnstool.it-help.tech/" class="gold-link">DNS Tool</a>** is one practical option.
  Its current web build includes SMTP transport verification, DMARCbis readiness checks, MPIC-aware CAA context, and CT subdomain discovery.
- For delivery-path testing with real sent messages and header review, **<a href="https://redsift.com/tools/investigate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="gold-link">Red Sift Investigate</a>** is useful.
- For DNS history and ownership context, **<a href="https://securitytrails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="gold-link">SecurityTrails</a>** can help.

The goal is evidence, not a specific vendor: baseline, implement, validate, monitor.

## Step-by-Step Guide to DMARC Protection (SPF + DKIM + DMARC)

If you're new to DNS security, here's a simple checklist to help you set up DMARC, SPF, and DKIM:

> **Note:** This guide is for **custom domain owners** (e.g. `you@yourbusiness.com`). If you use a free address like `@gmail.com` or `@yahoo.com`, you cannot edit these records—this guide is not for you.

Before making changes, run a baseline scan and save the results so you can compare before/after behavior.

If you want to test how your emails are currently landing (e.g. Inbox vs Spam), visit **<a href="https://redsift.com/tools/investigate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="gold-link">Red Sift's Investigate</a>**, copy their test email address, and send an email to it from your **CRM, newsletter platform, or invoicing system**. Testing from your actual business tools is critical to spotting third-party delivery issues.  


In brief: SPF specifies which servers can send on your behalf (like a return-address check) [^2], DKIM attaches a digital signature to emails (proving the email hasn't been tampered with) [^3], and DMARC ties everything together with a policy and reporting [^1].

**SPF**
1.  Verify domain ownership.
    a.  The Registrar is where the yearly bill is paid (and could also be the place to edit DNS records – the DNS Host).
    b.  The NS server records tell you where to edit the DNS records; they are the DNS hosts. (This could be GoDaddy, Wix, or another; the two NS servers will give you a hint if you Google them.)
    c.  Choose a DNS host with MFA, change history, and reliable rollback controls.
2.  Create an SPF record listing authorized email servers:
    a.  The two most typical are:
        * `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all` (for Google guidance)
        * `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all` (Microsoft's historical default; in modern DMARC-enforced domains, `~all` is often safer)
    b.  After you construct your policy, copy it into your DNS.
    c.  Note that the two above records do not have entries for other things that may need to send email as your domain (Email Marketing, receipts, and invoices).
    d.  RFC 7208 §4.6.4 caps SPF DNS lookups at 10 — exceeding this causes a `permerror` and can fail SPF validation entirely [^2].

**DMARC**
1.  Set up a DMARC policy.
    a.  Start with a monitoring policy (e.g., `p=none`).
    b.  After you construct your policy, copy it into your DNS. Be sure to specify an email address in the `rua` tag in the DMARC record to receive reports, and monitor them for insights.
    c.  If your DMARC policy remains `p=none`, your domain is still in observation mode. Progress to `p=quarantine`, then `p=reject` after legitimate senders are aligned.

**DKIM**
1.  Log in to Microsoft Exchange or Google Workspace (your email service provider) to get your DKIM keys, which you'll also publish in your DNS records.
    a.  DKIM selectors are part of the DKIM record that helps differentiate between multiple keys published under the same domain. This is useful for organizations that send emails through various systems or services (Email Marketing).
    b.  After you find your DKIM keys, copy them into your DNS. RFC 8301 normatively deprecated SHA-1 with RSA for DKIM signing; for key length, the same RFC says signers SHOULD use RSA keys of at least 2048 bits where supported, which has become the operational baseline because 1024-bit keys provide a much smaller margin against modern factoring resources [^14].
    c.  Make sure you hit Activate or Start Authentication in Google or Publish in Exchange.

After SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are stable, add transport-layer controls where possible: **MTA-STS** (RFC 8461) [^5], **TLS-RPT** (RFC 8460) [^6], and **DANE/TLSA for SMTP** (RFC 7672) [^7]. MTA-STS lets you advertise a policy that receiving mail servers must use TLS with a valid certificate; TLS-RPT requests aggregated reports of TLS negotiation failures so you can detect downgrade attempts; DANE binds your TLS certificate to your DNS records via DNSSEC, making certificate-substitution attacks visible.

Test the setup using your preferred auditor (for example **<a href="https://dnstool.it-help.tech/" class="gold-link">DNS Tool</a>**). Validate SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and transport findings together so you confirm policy and real behavior, not just record presence.

To do a final delivery test, go back to **<a href="https://redsift.com/tools/investigate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="gold-link">Red Sift Investigate</a>** and send another email to confirm your updated authentication is passing in real mail flow.

Monitor and adjust as needed.

As your program matures, include DMARCbis readiness checks, CAA review, and CT log monitoring so you catch policy drift and new exposure early.

## DNSSEC for Extra Security — and What It Doesn't Do

DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions, RFCs 4033/4034/4035) protects against DNS spoofing by cryptographically signing DNS responses, giving validating resolvers origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity [^8]. It is a meaningful defense against on-path forgery of DNS responses — the class of attack made famous by Dan Kaminsky's 2008 cache-poisoning vulnerability — and it is the foundation that DANE/TLSA depends on [^7].

Two honest scoping notes are worth making explicit. First, DNSSEC authenticates the DNS *response* (that the IP address or DKIM key you got from DNS is genuinely the one the zone owner published). It does not authenticate the *email content* — that is what DKIM does — and it does not encrypt mail in transit. Second, global DNSSEC adoption remains uneven: a substantial fraction of authoritative zones publish signed records, but a much smaller fraction of recursive resolvers actually validate. Deploying DNSSEC on your own zone is high-value when paired with DANE; treating it as a substitute for DMARC or transport TLS is a category error.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

When setting up DMARC and SPF, watch out for these common mistakes:
* Incorrectly formatted DNS records, spaces left before or after, or incorrect format.
* Not updating DNS records after changing email providers.
* Setting overly strict policies initially.
* Be cautious with automated "DNS auto-fix" platforms that request full zone access. Some tools modify records beyond the intended scope. Review diffs before publishing and keep a rollback snapshot of your zone file.



## FAQs: Your DNS Security Questions Answered

* **Can I set up DMARC and SPF myself?**
    Yes, but it's advisable to <a href="/services/" class="gold-link">consult a DNS security expert</a> if you are unsure.
* **What happens if I don't set up DMARC or SPF?**
    Your domain remains easier to impersonate in phishing and BEC campaigns, which can damage trust, disrupt operations, and create direct financial risk.

## BIMI

Beyond email authentication, Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) can improve logo trust signals in supporting inboxes. BIMI requires an enforced DMARC policy (`p=quarantine` or `p=reject`) as a precondition, and the BIMI specification — published by the AuthIndicators Working Group — defines the SVG and Verified Mark Certificate requirements [^15]. Example: Apple's BIMI record points to `https://www.apple.com/bimi/v2/apple.svg`.

## Conclusion

DNS security failures are rarely caused by missing records; they are caused by misinterpreting what those records actually enforce.

Securing your domain and email system is both a technical and business requirement. Implementing DMARC, SPF, and DKIM, then validating transport and issuance controls, materially reduces spoofing and BEC risk.

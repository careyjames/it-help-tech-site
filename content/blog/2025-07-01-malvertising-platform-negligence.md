TL;DR – If you still trust the first result in a search engine or the community standards team at a social-network giant, you’re playing Russian roulette with your credentials. This post walks through exactly how scammers abuse paid ads and social-media blind spots, shows live evidence, and closes with a pragmatic hardening checklist you can implement today.


1  The Anatomy of a Modern Malvertising Funnel

1. **Paid Placement** – Attackers buy a “Sponsored” slot for a high‑value keyword (e.g. *facebook*). Google’s automated auction system accepts the ad because it appears legitimate on the surface.[^malwarebytes]

2. **Staging hop** – Two common flavours  
   * **External redirect:** Ad → throw‑away domain (often Cloudflare‑fronted) → fake login.  
   * **Platform‑internal:** Ad lands on an attacker‑controlled Facebook Page (still `facebook.com`), which then bounce‑redirects visitors to the phishing host via a disguised “Continue” button or OG preview.

3. **Credential Harvest** – Typing your username + password into the cloned form sends them straight to the attacker. SMS/TOTP codes can be replay‑proxied, but hardware FIDO2 / security‑key challenges **cannot** be intercepted—so if you logged into the real Facebook page with your USB‑Security key, the phish failed.

Take-away: The blue “Ad” tag is not a trust seal – it’s the attack surface.


2  Tech-Support Pop-Ups: Old Tricks, New Skins

 - The page weaponises JavaScript alert loops to lock the browser, then abuses Apple’s brand to coerce a phone call.  
 - Call‑centre scripts typically walk victims through installing remote‑desktop tooling or paying for bogus “clean‑up” software. (Hear the recorded call below.)

3  Facebook’s Reporting Black-Hole

Despite clear evidence of credential theft:
 - **Support Inbox Shrug:** The platform replies “Doesn’t go against our Community Standards.”  
 - **Lifeboating:** Even when a single post is nuked, the same advertiser spins up a new account minutes later – a problem the UK FCA publicly called Meta out for in April 2025.[^guardian]

Translation: At scale, reactive moderation is theatre. Attackers move faster than the appeals queue.


4  Why This Persists

| Actor | Incentive | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Search‑engine ad platform | Revenue per click; speed over scrutiny | Malvertising accepted by default |
| Social network | Engagement metrics; legal safe‑harbour mindset | Slow or no takedown of scam content |
| User | Convenience bias; search‑navigation habit | Credentials & money stolen |

Until the economics change (e.g. **strong** financial liability for enabling fraud), the cycle repeats.


5  Hardening Checklist (10-Minute Audit)
	1.	Stop relying on search for logins. Bookmark the canonical domain or use a password-manager vault link.
	2.	Install an ad/tracker blocklist (uBlock Origin, Pi-hole, NextDNS) and enable EasyPrivacy + Malware domains.
	3.	Force HTTPS & verify EV where applicable. No lock icon ≠ no go.
	4.	Deploy hardware-bound FIDO2 keys; phishing proxies can’t replay WebAuthn challenges.
	5.	Use DNSSEC-validated resolvers (Quad9, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 with DNS over TLS) to blunt typo-squats.
	6.	On macOS: enable Lockdown Mode for high-risk users, and keep Gatekeeper + XProtect signatures current.
	7.	For orgs: ingest ad-click telemetry into your SIEM and auto-isolate hosts that resolve known rogue domains.


6  Share & Amplify

Cut through the “user error” narrative. The culprits are the platforms that monetize first and moderate later. Feel free to re-share these assets (attribution appreciated) and let’s keep the pressure on.

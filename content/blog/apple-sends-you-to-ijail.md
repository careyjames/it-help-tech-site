Your **Apple Account** (formerly "Apple ID") unlocks your entire iUniverse—from iPhone to iCloud. It controls email, contacts, the App Store, and more. Getting locked out can put a serious damper on your digital freedom.

There are several reasons you might end up locked out:

- You typed your password incorrectly too many times.
- Someone answered your security questions or other info too many times.
- A hacker compromised your account and changed the password.

If it happens, you’ll see an alert such as:

- "This Apple Account has been disabled for security reasons."
- "You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons."
- "This Apple Account has been locked for security reasons."

## How many password guesses are too many?

Apple doesn’t publish an exact limit for ordinary sign‑ins. If you’ve enabled hardware **security keys**, your account locks after the **sixth** consecutive failure. Either way, stop after the second or third bad try and go to [iforgot.apple.com](https://iforgot.apple.com).

## How to Unlock your Apple Account

Apple offers several ways to regain access. Unlocking usually means resetting your password. In some cases you may be locked out for a period of time. If the alert says you must wait, there isn’t much you can do but start **Account Recovery** and wait—Apple warns the process can take several days or longer.

### Method 1: Reset your password on your iPhone or Mac

On your iPhone: `Settings` → **Your Name** → `Sign‑In & Security` → `Change Password`.

On your Mac: open `System Settings`, click **Your Name** → `Password & Security` → `Change Password`.

Follow the prompts. If you don’t have your Apple device, you can reset from a new device during setup, borrow a friend’s, or visit the Apple Store.

### Method 2: Reset your password on the web at iforgot.apple.com

Using a secure browser, visit [iforgot.apple.com](https://iforgot.apple.com) and follow the prompts. After changing your password remember to update it on all your devices and services.

### Method 3: Contact Apple Support

If nothing else works, visit Apple’s support page and call the number for your region. Be ready to verify your identity.

### What happens if you enter the wrong password too many times on a Mac?

If you can’t unlock right away, request access on the alert screen or go to [iforgot.apple.com](https://iforgot.apple.com) and begin **Account Recovery**. Apple says the wait "can be several days or longer." A paired security key can instantly unlock the account on‑device once you regain access.

It can get complicated if you can’t verify your account during the recovery process. As long as you have the answers to your security questions or access to your primary or recovery emails, you should be okay, but not necessarily. Some users report being locked out even after verifying identity with Apple Support.

Punish criminals, not customers. Security isn’t secure when users can’t use it.

## 8 Tips to Avoid Getting Locked Out

Securing your Mac before problems happen is the easiest way to avoid iJail. These tips ensure you can recover your account if it does happen. (On a Mac, look for `Password & Security` where you see `Sign‑In & Security` below.)

1. **Use a secure password.** Don’t let criminals guess their way into your account.
2. **Set up Two‑Factor Authentication.** `Settings` → **Your Name** → `Sign‑In & Security` → `Two‑Factor Authentication`.
3. **Passkeys.** Set up passkeys and consider a physical security key like Yubico. A paired key can unlock a frozen account instantly once you have access.
4. **Set up a Recovery Key.** `Settings` → **Your Name** → `Sign‑In & Security` → `Account Recovery` → `Recovery Key`. Print it and store it safely—never in Notes.
5. **Recovery Contacts.** `Settings` → **Your Name** → `Sign‑In & Security` → `Account Recovery` → `Add Recovery Contact`.
6. **Add a trusted phone number.** On Mac: `System Settings` → **Your Name** → `Password & Security` → `Trusted Phone Numbers`.
7. **Know your security questions.* (Legacy accounts only; newer accounts rely on 2FA.)*
8. **Watch out for hackers.** Beware of phishing emails or phone scams urging you to click links or give remote access.

Doing these simple things will save you a ton of hassle from being put in iJail in the future. In digital security, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

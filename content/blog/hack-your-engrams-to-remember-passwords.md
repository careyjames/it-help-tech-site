### TL;DR
Negativity bias—our brain’s tendency to *magnify and store* bad or taboo experiences—can be exploited to make **long, unforgettable pass-phrases** that still satisfy the latest NIST password rules. Example:

DidYourBro4Times!

It’s outrageous, deeply emotional, and **not** traceable to publicly searchable facts, so it sticks in your head but stays off an attacker’s radar.

## Why the Trick Works
* **Negativity bias:** Humans remember negative information more vividly than neutral or positive data [[Baumeister et al., 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3652533/)].
* **Emotion-driven consolidation:** High arousal triggers the amygdala, boosting long-term potentiation and locking the “engram” in place [[Paré & Headley, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10034520/)].
Result: one shocking phrase ➜ memory Velcro.

## Building a Compliant “Bad-Memory” Pass-Phrase
NIST SP 800-63B (Section 5.1.1.2) says verifiers should permit **64-character pass-phrases, any Unicode, no mandatory complexity rules** [[NIST 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)].
Follow three rules:

1. **Three-plus uncommon words + digit + symbol**  
   *Good:* `DidYourBro4Times!`  
   *Also good:* `IWantToSellMyKids2025!` (kids never see you type it, nobody else can guess).
2. **No public facts** – skip birthdays, addresses, pet names.
3. **Unique everywhere** – one site, one secret.

> **Forced-disclosure scenario:** A gun to your head defeats *any* single-factor password. This trick isn’t worse; it just improves recall under normal conditions.

## Quick Risk Check
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Targeted guessing via public info | Keep phrases fictional or private and *weird*. |
| Daily emotional drain | Pick **absurd** negative imagery, not genuine trauma. |
| Kids shoulder-surfing | Use a phrase you’d *never* type in front of them. |

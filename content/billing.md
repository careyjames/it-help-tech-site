## IT Consulting & Support Rates

* **Base Rate:** $275 per hour
* **Minimum Charges:**
  * **On-site service:** 1-hour minimum (**this first hour functions as a booking deposit**)
  * **Remote / phone / screen-sharing support:** 30-minute minimum (**booking deposit**)
* **Billing Increments:** All work beyond the initial minimum is billed precisely in **1-minute increments**, based on session timers or documented offline work.
* **Travel:** $1.50 per mile for on-site visits.
  * Locations within 15 miles: one-way mileage
  * Locations beyond 15 miles: round-trip mileage **plus billable drive time**

## Booking & Payment Policy

* **Booking Deposit:** Appointments are reserved only after the minimum charge is authorized:
  * On-site: **1 hour**
  * Remote: **30 minutes**

  This deposit applies directly to the first block of service time and is **not** an extra fee.

* **Payment Method:** A valid credit card is required to book services. We do not accept checks and do not offer net terms. **No card, no service — no exceptions.**
* **How Billing Works:**
  * Scope and estimated time are agreed upon in advance whenever practical.
  * Charges are applied only for time actually worked.
  * Billing occurs after each completed session or day of service.
  * Invoices clearly itemize total time worked, billing increments applied, service type (on-site or remote), and the date(s) services were performed.

We do not bill recurring fees, retainers, or unattended time.

⸻

## Scheduling & Cancellation

* **Cancellation / Rescheduling:** At least **24 hours’ notice** is required to avoid charges.
* **Late Cancellations / No-Shows:** Cancellations with less than 24 hours’ notice or missed appointments are billed for the **minimum booked time**, as that time was reserved exclusively for you.

⸻

## Quick Questions & Brief Communications

* Existing clients may call, text, or email at any time.
* Brief communications under **10 minutes** are not billed.
* Calls, remote sessions, or other work exceeding 10 minutes are billable at the standard rate, subject to the **30-minute minimum**.

⸻

## Privacy, Security & Ethics

* All client data is encrypted and never shared or sold.
* We have served high-profile and security-sensitive clients for over 25 years.
* We have never had a data leak and never speak with media or third parties.

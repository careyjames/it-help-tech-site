We follow clear policies for our IT support services. No monthly retainers!

## IT Consulting & Support Rate {#it-consulting--support-rate}

* **Base Rate:** $275 per hour.
* **Minimum Charge:** 1-hour minimum for on-site, 30-minute minimum for remote/phone.
* **Billing Increments:** We bill precisely in **1-minute increments**, based on call/session timers or time tracked for offline tasks.
* **Travel:** $1.50â€¯perâ€¯mile for every onâ€‘site visit. For sites within 15â€¯miles we bill oneâ€‘way mileage; beyond 15â€¯miles we bill roundâ€‘trip mileage plus drive time.

This policy covers real operational costs and ensures continued reliability.

## Payment Policy {#payment-policy}

* **Method:** We require a valid credit card on file before services are rendered.
* **Billing Cycle:** Billing occurs automatically **at the end of each session or day's work** to the authorized card on file.
* **Terms:** We do not accept checks or offer net payment terms. **No card, no serviceâ€”no exceptions.**

## Scheduling & Cancellation Policy {#scheduling--cancellation-policy}

* **Booking:** Appointments are booked with a 30-minute minimum charge (deposit) for remote sessions, which reserves that time specifically for you.
* **Billing:** You are only billed for the time used beyond the initial 30-minute minimum.
* **Notice:** To reschedule or cancel without charge, please provide at least **24 hoursâ€™ notice**.
* **Late/No-Show:** Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) or no-shows will be billed for the 30-minute minimum, as that time was held exclusively for you.

## Quick Phone/Text/Email Support {#quick-phonetextemail-support}

* Existing clients are welcome to reach out anytime.
* We do not charge for brief communications (under 10 minutes).
* All calls, remote sessions, or other time spent rendering services lasting more than 10 minutes are billed at our standard rate, subject to the 30-minute minimum.

## Privacy & Security {#privacy--security-}

* All client data (login credentials, network configurations, etc.) is encrypted and is never shared or sold.
* We have served high-profile, sensitive security and entertainment businesses for 25 years.
* We have never had a data leak or spoken with paparazzi/journalists.  
Your trust is paramount.

## Business Ethics: Careyâ€™s Promise {#business-ethics-careyâ€™s-promise-}

As the Founder of IT Help San Diego Inc., I see my role as a scientist, not a salesperson. My recommendations are based on transparent, verifiable data, not opinions or distributor deals. <strong class="ethics-statement">We donâ€™t sell products, and we donâ€™t accept commissions, affiliate fees, or kickbacks.</strong> We donâ€™t depend upon a 40% markup (from a limited catalog) for survival, and thus are not restricted to lower-spec gear. If we recommend a solution, whether it's Route 53, SentinelOne, or 1Password, it's because we believe it's the best tool for the job. We'll show you the options, explain the *why*, and you'll typically purchase directly from the vendor. Our only revenue comes from our time and expertise dedicated to implementing these solutions effectively for you. My focus is always on your long-term reliabilityâ€”truly listening so I can help you understand exactly what you wantâ€”and delivering real value.

## Final Notes

Our expertise covers Mac, Linux, Windows, enterprise networking, and high-end tech solutions. We provide discreet cyber-security and crisis response services, backed by nearly two decades of hands-on experience.

We follow clear policies for our IT support services. **No monthly retainers!**

## IT Consulting & Support Rate  

* **Base Rate:** $275 per hour.
* **Minimum Charge:** 1-hour minimum for on-site, 30-minute minimum for remote or phone support.
* **Billing Increments:** We bill precisely in **1-minute increments**, based on call or session timers or time tracked for offline tasks.
* **Travel:** $1.50 per mile for every onâ€‘site visit. For sites under 15 miles, we bill one-way mileage; for sites above 15 miles, we bill round-trip mileage plus drive time.

This policy covers real operational costs and ensures continued reliability.

## Payment Policy  

* **Method:** We require a valid credit card on file before services are rendered.
* **Billing Cycle:** Billing occurs automatically **at the end of each session or day's work** to the authorized card on file.
* **Terms:** We do not accept checks and do not offer net payment terms. **No card, no service, no exceptions.**

## Scheduling & Cancellation Policy  

* **Booking:** Appointments are booked with a 30-minute minimum charge (deposit) for remote sessions, which reserves that time specifically for you.
* **Billing:** You are only billed for the time used beyond the initial 30-minute minimum.
* **Notice:** To reschedule or cancel without charge, please provide at least **24 hoursâ€™ notice**.
* **Late/No-Show:** Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) or no-shows will be billed for the 30-minute minimum, as that time was held exclusively for you.

## Quick Phone/Text/Email Support  

* Existing clients are welcome to reach out anytime.
* We do not charge for brief communications (under 10 minutes).
* All calls, remote sessions, or other time spent rendering services lasting more than 10 minutes are billed at our standard rate, subject to the 30-minute minimum.

## Privacy & Security  

* All client data (login credentials, network configurations, etc.) is encrypted and is NEVER shared or sold.
* We have served high-profile, sensitive security and entertainment businesses for 25 years.
* We have never had a data leak or spoken with paparazzi/journalists. Your trust is paramount.

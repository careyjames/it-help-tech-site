### 2026-04-25 — Field-note primary-source rigor pass: 4 broken/wrong citation URLs fixed, IEEE 802.11 base bumped 2020→2024 (REVme), BibTeX file resynced
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner asked for clean-slate primary-source re-verification of every claim in `why-your-wireless-network-sucks`; this entry catalogs the issues that pass found and what was fixed).
- Scope: Following the TIA-568.2-E correction earlier today (entry below), the owner asked for a full re-verification of every numbered claim and every cited URL in `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md`. The pass verified all numerical claims (PoE wattages 60 W PSE / 51 W PD min for Type 3, 90 W PSE / 71.3 W PD min for Type 4 per IEEE 802.3bt-2018; Cat6 10GBASE-T reach of 55 m / 37 m per TIA TSB-155; Cat8 30 m channel length per IEEE 802.3bq-2016; Cat5e/6/6A/8 frequency ratings of 100/250/500/2000 MHz; Cat6 24 AWG and Cat6A 23 AWG typical conductor gauges per ANSI/TIA-568.2 series), every standard publication date, every DOI (Bianchi 2000 10.1109/49.840210; Shannon 1948 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x; Akyildiz/Wang/Wang 2005 10.1016/j.comnet.2004.12.001), and the math (Shannon-Hartley C = B·log₂(1+S/N); -3 dB ≈ halving of linear S/N; the qualified 1/2ⁿ per-hop math). It surfaced four citation defects and one staleness issue, all fixed in this commit:
- Defects fixed:
  1. **Footnote [^5] URL pointed at the WRONG standard.** `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11ax/7345/` resolves to "IEEE 802.1X-2020 — Port-Based Network Access Control" (an unrelated security standard), NOT IEEE 802.11ax-2021. Corrected to `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11ax/7180/` (verified to load the correct 802.11ax-2021 page). This is the most serious defect in the pass — readers clicking the citation would have been sent to a totally unrelated standard.
  2. **Footnote [^10] URL was a 404.** `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.3bz/6280/` returned the IEEE SA "page removed or temporarily unavailable" placeholder. Corrected to `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.3bz/6130/` (verified to load IEEE 802.3bz-2016). Title text also corrected from "Amendment 3" to "Amendment 7" (the actual amendment number on the IEEE SA page; the original text mis-numbered it).
  3. **Footnote [^13] URL was a 404.** `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.3bq/5957/` returned the same IEEE SA "page removed" placeholder. Corrected to `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.3bq/6227/` (verified to load IEEE 802.3bq-2016).
  4. **`static/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.bib` was out of sync with the article.** The companion BibTeX file still defined `@techreport{tia_568_2_d, ... year = {2018}, url = {https://tiaonline.org/products/ansi-tia-568-2-d/}}` even after PR #610 corrected the article body to cite -E (2024). Replaced with `@techreport{tia_568_2_e, ... year = {2024}, url = {tia-publishes-new-standards-ansi-tia-568-2-e-and-ansi-tia-568-5-1}}`. The same `.bib` file also carried all three of the broken/wrong URLs above; all now corrected to match the article footnotes.
- Staleness issue fixed (primary-source-currency rigor — the same lesson PR #610 just learned):
  5. **Footnote [^1] cited IEEE Std 802.11-2020 (REVmd).** That base standard has been superseded by IEEE Std 802.11-2024 (REVme), published April 28, 2025 (per the official IEEE 802.11 working group page). The substantive CSMA/CA half-duplex behaviour cited in the field note is unchanged across the revision, but citing the current rolled-up base is the right thing to do per primary-source rigor — exactly the lesson recorded in the TIA-568.2-D→E correction entry below. Updated [^1] to cite `IEEE Std 802.11-2024 (REVme)` at `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11/10548/` with an explicit note that 802.11-2020 remains an authoritative reference for the unchanged CSMA/CA behaviour, so existing scholarship that cites 802.11-2020 is not invalidated.
- "Verified against" trailer expanded: now lists IEEE 802.11-2024 (REVme), IEEE 802.11ax-2021, IEEE 802.11be-2024, IEEE 802.3-2022, IEEE 802.3bt-2018, IEEE 802.3bz-2016, IEEE 802.3bq-2016, ANSI/TIA-568.2-E (2024), TIA TSB-155 (the actual standard underlying the 55 m / 37 m Cat6 10GBASE-T reach figures, which previously sat under footnote [^11] without explicit attribution), and TIA TSB-184-A (2017). The TSB-155 attribution is informational — the article body already correctly attributes the 55 m / 37 m figures via [^11], and TIA-568.2 incorporates TSB-155 by reference, so the body text is unchanged.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md` — footnotes [^1], [^5], [^10], [^13] updated; "Last updated April 25, 2026 — verified against …" trailer expanded.
  - `static/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.bib` — five entries updated: `ieee_80211_2020`→`ieee_80211_2024`, `ieee_80211ax_2021` URL fix, `ieee_8023bz_2016` URL + amendment-number fix, `tia_568_2_d`→`tia_568_2_e`, `ieee_8023bq_2016` URL fix.
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Verification of fixes:
  - Every replacement URL was loaded directly via `webFetch` and confirmed to render the correct standard's IEEE SA listing page (titled "IEEE 802.11ax-2021", "IEEE 802.3bz-2016", "IEEE 802.3bq-2016", and "IEEE 802.11-2024" respectively).
  - All numerical claims independently re-verified against TIA, IEEE SA, Wikipedia (cross-check), Ethernet Alliance white paper (Power over Ethernet 802.3bt overview), and Fluke Networks knowledge base (TSB-155 distance specification).
  - `zola serve` rebuilds clean; live preview at `/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks/` renders the updated footnotes and trailer.
- Compliance posture:
  - **CSP / Mozilla Observatory:** zero impact — pure footnote and trailer text; URLs replaced, no new origins introduced (replacement URLs are on the same `standards.ieee.org` and `tiaonline.org` origins already in use).
  - **Lighthouse / WCAG:** zero impact.
  - **SEO:** modest positive — the page now correctly links to live IEEE SA listing pages for 802.11ax, 802.3bz, and 802.3bq instead of 404s and a totally wrong standard, which removes the "broken outbound link" signal Google Search Console would otherwise raise.
- Lesson learned (compounding the lesson from the TIA-568.2-E correction below): URL existence is necessary but not sufficient — when a citation URL points at a numeric IEEE SA `vendor_id`, *fetch the URL and verify the rendered page title matches the cited standard*. The 802.11ax citation had been "live but pointing at the wrong standard" since the original publication of this field note; that is exactly the failure mode that primary-source-existence-only checks miss. Going forward, the per-citation verification pass for any standards-heavy field note must include a "fetch and confirm page title" step, not just a "URL returns 200" step.
- Rollback: revert this commit. To roll back only one of the five corrections, the diff is small and partitioned by file region; cherry-pick the affected hunk(s).

### 2026-04-25 — CORRECTION: ANSI/TIA-568.2-E IS the current published standard (October/November 2024); prior verdict reversed
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-supplied research artifacts contradicted the prior architect verdict; primary-source re-verification confirmed the owner correct).
- Scope: Earlier today, the architect (see entry immediately below) rejected the claim that ANSI/TIA-568.2-E is the current ratified TIA twisted-pair cabling standard, asserting -D (2018) remained the active standard. The owner subsequently provided research artifacts (`attached_assets/tia_standards_2026_*.csv`, `attached_assets/wifi7_mlo_insights_*.md`, plus trade-press articles from cat6acabling.com and a LinkedIn Pulse summary) that contradicted that verdict. A fresh primary-source re-verification — hitting TIA's own announcement page and the official TIA distributor catalog directly, not vendor blogs — confirmed the owner's evidence: ANSI/TIA-568.2-E was published October 23, 2024, with TIA's public release announcement on November 5, 2024 (Arlington, VA); the document is ANSI-approved and listed as "Most Recent / Active" in TIA's official distributor catalog. The prior verdict was wrong, the field note now needs to cite -E (2024), and the prior log entry has been marked as superseded by this one.
- Primary sources confirmed:
  - TIA standards announcement (tiaonline.org): "Arlington VA (November 5, 2024) – The Telecommunications Industry Association ... has released two new documents, ANSI/TIA-568.2-E, Balanced Twisted-Pair Telecommunications Cabling and Components Standard and ANSI/TIA-568.5-1 ... ANSI/TIA-568.2-E will revise ANSI/TIA-568.2-D and correct known errors as well as update nomenclature." <https://tiaonline.org/standardannouncement/tia-publishes-new-standards-ansi-tia-568-2-e-and-ansi-tia-568-5-1/>
  - Accuris / Techstreet (TIA's official standards distributor): "TIA ANSI/TIA-568.2-E ✓ Most Recent [ Active ] ... standard by Telecommunications Industry Association, 10/23/2024 ... ANSI APPROVED." <https://store.accuristech.com/standards/tia-ansi-tia-568-2-e?product_id=2921304>
  - Siemon (TIA member vendor) industry confirmation: <https://www.siemon.com/en/ansi-tia-568-2-e-released/>
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md` —
    - Updated the body sentence in the "Scientific Facts: Cabling, Bandwidth, and the Standards That Define Them" section from "the ANSI/TIA-568.2-D twisted-pair cabling standard" to "the ANSI/TIA-568.2-E twisted-pair cabling standard".
    - Rewrote footnote [^11] to correctly cite ANSI/TIA-568.2-E (2024) as the current published, ANSI-approved standard. The new footnote includes the publication date (Oct 23, 2024), the TIA announcement date (Nov 5, 2024), the explicit "supersedes -D (2018)" framing, and both the TIA announcement URL and the Accuris/Techstreet listing URL. Removed the prior incorrect line stating "as of April 2026, the 'E' revision is under active development ... has not yet superseded -D as the ratified standard."
    - Updated the in-body "Last updated April 25, 2026 — verified against …" trailer to list "ANSI/TIA-568.2-E (2024, supersedes -D)" instead of "ANSI/TIA-568.2-D (with TIA-568.2-E revision noted as in-development)".
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this correction entry, plus an inline `**[CORRECTED 2026-04-25 — see entry above; ANSI/TIA-568.2-E IS the current published standard, October/November 2024]**` marker added to the now-superseded TIA-568.2-E sentences in the entry immediately below. Original wording is preserved verbatim; the marker makes the supersession unambiguous in the historical record.
- Why: The field note's positioning as a primary-source-research differentiator is undermined far more by miscategorizing a published, ANSI-approved 2024 standard as "still in development" than by almost anything else we could ship. The owner's research artifacts and the TIA primary sources together confirm -E was published Q4 2024; leaving the field note pointing at -D (with a forward-reference saying -E "is not yet published") on a high-traffic technical reference page would be a credibility-shattering error. The owner caught it, primary sources confirm it, and correcting it now — before PR #609 is merged — is the right move.
- Compliance posture:
  - **CSP / Mozilla Observatory:** zero impact. Pure-prose footnote rewrite plus a body-line standard-version bump.
  - **Lighthouse:** zero impact. No new assets, no layout change.
  - **WCAG:** zero impact. Same semantic markdown.
  - **SEO:** strongly positive. The page now accurately ranks for "ANSI/TIA-568.2-E" queries (the current published standard, with active search volume) instead of forward-referencing an in-development status that was wrong. The current `dateModified` (2026-04-25) is preserved.
- Verification:
  - Primary-source re-verification via the TIA announcement page, the Accuris/Techstreet listing, and the Siemon vendor confirmation page (URLs above). The TIA announcement text was fetched directly from `tiaonline.org` and quoted verbatim in this entry.
  - `zola serve` rendered the corrected footnote and body line cleanly at `/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks/`. Footnote backref still resolves.
- Lesson learned: when a technical claim hinges on a standard's publication status, hit the standards body's own announcement page and the official distributor's catalog directly before accepting an internal verdict that says "not yet ratified." The prior architect verdict relied on stale knowledge; the trade-press article the owner attached was correct. Architect verdicts are not infallible — when external evidence directly contradicts them, escalate to primary sources rather than defaulting to the prior verdict.
- Rollback: revert this commit. To preserve the rest of PR #609 (the Wi-Fi 7 MLO/STR/EMLSR/NSTR precision paragraph) without this correction, cherry-pick only the field-note diff blocks for body line 94, footnote [^11], and the "verified against" trailer; the log entry reverts cleanly.

### 2026-04-25 — Wi-Fi 7 MLO/STR/EMLSR/NSTR precision addition + TIA-568.2-E status note in `why-your-wireless-network-sucks` field note
- Actor: AI+Developer (architect-driven precision update following owner-supplied external research draft).
- Scope: Owner received an external research draft proposing several revisions to the field note. The architect ran a per-claim cross-check and verified each claim against the actual ratified standards. The verdict matrix: ADOPT-WITH-CHANGES the Multi-Link Operation / Simultaneous Transmit-Receive (STR) mechanics for Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be-2024) with explicit EMLSR/NSTR caveats; REJECT every other proposed change, including the claim that ANSI/TIA-568.2-E is the 2026 ratified standard (it is not — TIA TR-42.7 is still working on the -E revision; -D from 2018 remains the active ratified standard) **[CORRECTED 2026-04-25 — see entry above; ANSI/TIA-568.2-E IS the current published standard, published October 23, 2024, TIA announcement November 5, 2024, ANSI-approved; the architect verdict cited here was wrong]**; REJECT the proposed "Cat6: Avoid. High PoE heat." reversion (would undo the PR #607 architect-mandated softening to "design margin, not capability"); REJECT "Cat8 in short bursts (<30m)" (factual error: 30 m is a channel-length limit, not a temporal-burst limit); REJECT "throwing away 75%" hyperbole (clashes with the field note's measured-engineering voice); REJECT the universalized 50%-per-hop math (our qualified single-radio/shared-backhaul framing is more accurate for dual-radio mesh and Wi-Fi 7 MLO gear); MAINTAIN the "typically 24 AWG vs 23 AWG" hedging (real-world Cat6/Cat6A AWG varies 22-24 AWG by manufacturer; TIA-568.2-D specifies performance, not mandatory AWG) **[CORRECTED 2026-04-25 — TIA-568.2-E (2024) now specifies performance; the AWG hedge remains correct, only the standard reference is superseded]**.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md` —
    - **Inserted a new precision paragraph in the "Case 1: Modern Wi-Fi 6/7 mesh with a wired backhaul" subsection** of the "When Wireless Mesh Actually Works" section, between the "old adage being challenged" paragraph and the "*The catch*" paragraph. The new paragraph names IEEE 802.11be-2024's Multi-Link Operation explicitly, defines STR (Simultaneous Transmit and Receive) as the mode that lets an MLO-capable device communicate across non-overlapping bands (typically 5 GHz and 6 GHz) at the same time, identifies STR as the mechanism behind genuine throughput gains on properly-deployed Wi-Fi 7 hardware, and adds the architect-required honest qualifier: not all "Wi-Fi 7" hardware actually supports STR — many implement EMLSR (Enhanced Multi-Link Single Radio) or NSTR (Non-STR) because in-device filtering to prevent cross-band desensitization is expensive to build correctly. The paragraph closes with the standing precision: MLO softens the per-hop penalty but does not eliminate the physics of shared spectrum or the need for a wired backhaul.
    - **Updated footnote [^11]** to add a one-line forward-reference clarifying that as of April 2026 the TIA-568.2-E revision is under active development by the TIA TR-42.7 subcommittee but has not yet superseded -D as the ratified standard, so primary-source citations should continue to reference -D. This pre-empts the (incorrect) "TIA. (2026). ANSI/TIA-568.2-E" framing in the external research draft and any similar future claims. **[CORRECTED 2026-04-25 — see correction entry above; ANSI/TIA-568.2-E IS the current published standard (Oct 23, 2024 publication; Nov 5, 2024 TIA public announcement; ANSI-approved). Footnote [^11] has been rewritten to cite -E (2024) as the current standard. The original incorrect "in-development" footnote text has been removed from the live field note.]**
    - **Updated frontmatter `updated:` field**, the in-body "Last updated" line, and JSON-LD `dateModified` to `2026-04-25`. The "verified against" trailer now lists IEEE 802.11be-2024 (with the specific MLO/STR/EMLSR/NSTR mode definitions called out by name) and notes that TIA-568.2-D is the verified standard with the -E revision noted as in-development.
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Why: The field note is one of the firm's most-cited primary-source technical documents and is the most-trafficked piece of long-form content on the site. The owner positions this content explicitly as a primary-source-research differentiator. Citing a non-existent or non-yet-ratified standard (TIA-568.2-E (2026)) would directly contradict that positioning and damage the firm's technical credibility. Conversely, *adding* the STR/EMLSR/NSTR precision is high-value: Wi-Fi 7 MLO is the most-asked-about new wireless technology in 2026, and most consumer-grade explanations either (a) ignore the mode distinction entirely (calling everything "Wi-Fi 7 MLO" as if it were uniform), or (b) overstate STR availability (implying every Wi-Fi 7 AP gets the simultaneous-band benefit when many do not). Naming EMLSR and NSTR by acronym puts the field note ahead of the marketing-grade explanations that dominate search results.
- Compliance posture:
  - **CSP / Mozilla Observatory:** zero impact. Pure-prose addition + footnote text expansion + date refresh. No new external origins, no inline scripts, no header changes.
  - **Lighthouse:** zero impact. ~250 words of additional body text on an already-long-form article; no new images, no new CSS, no new JS. The JSON-LD `dateModified` change is a one-character date-string update.
  - **WCAG:** semantic markdown throughout; no color-only signals; the new acronyms (STR, EMLSR, NSTR) are introduced with their full expansions on first use, satisfying WCAG 3.1.4 (Abbreviations) for an Intermediate-proficiency technical audience.
  - **SEO:** modest positive — the page now ranks for "STR Wi-Fi 7," "EMLSR vs STR," and "NSTR" queries that previously did not match the page. The `dateModified` refresh signals freshness to crawlers. The TIA-568.2-E forward-reference establishes topical authority for "TIA-568.2-E ratification status" queries that will spike as the revision moves toward publication.
- Architect review: full per-claim verdict matrix and verification of TIA-568.2-E publication status captured in the architect advisory; only the two architect-approved changes (STR paragraph + -E status note) were applied. Every other proposed change from the external research draft was rejected on architect-verified technical grounds.
- Rollback: revert this commit. Field note returns to the post-PR #607 baseline; PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG entry reverts cleanly. No infrastructure, CSP, or response-header changes to unwind. Branches off `bc4a6a2`.
### 2026-04-25 — New `/full-day-engagements/` page: dedicated full-day, extended-day, and multi-day engagement model
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-supplied page copy after multiple internal review cycles; final draft labeled "production-grade, no weak points").
- Scope: Add a new top-level page that productizes full-day ($1,900 flat / 8h), extended-day ($2,900 flat / 12h), and multi-day engagements as a distinct class of service from the standard $275/hour billing model. The differentiator is explicit: capacity reservations with primary-source technical research, validation, and synthesis — language deliberately chosen to signal RFC-level thinking and evidence-backed decisions, separating the firm from both reactive break/fix IT and abstract management consulting.
- Files:
  - `content/full-day-engagements.md` (NEW) — full page with frontmatter (`title`, `description`, `path: full-day-engagements`, `extra.skip_image`, `extra.skip_author`) matching the conventions used by `content/billing.md` and `content/services.md`. Sections: intro callout, Full-Day & Extended Engagements (5-bullet capability list including the differentiating "Primary-source technical research, validation, and synthesis" line), Pricing (Full-Day 8h $1,900 / Extended 12h $2,900 / Additional time at $275/h), How This Works (capacity-reservation framing, not hourly bundles), Why This Model Exists, Pricing Philosophy ("No upselling. No hidden incentives. No time inflation."), Multi-Day Engagements, When to Use, Final Notes (Depth over fragmentation / Speed through continuity / Precision through sustained focus). Closes with `<p class="final-tagline">DEEP WORK. CLEAR SYSTEMS. ZERO NOISE.</p>` matching the `final-tagline` convention used on `/billing/`. Includes JSON-LD `Service` block with three nested `Offer` entries (Full-Day, Extended Day, Additional Time) for SEO/structured-data parity with the `Offer` and `FAQPage` blocks already on `/billing/`.
  - `content/billing.md` — (1) added a one-line cross-reference paragraph immediately after the Specialty Rate bullet in the "IT Consulting & Support Rates" section: "For complex projects that benefit from sustained focus, primary-source research, and uninterrupted execution, see **[Full-Day & Multi-Day Engagements →](/full-day-engagements/)**." (2) Drive-by latent-bug fix: corrected the `Offer.itemOffered.provider.@id` from `https://www.it-help.tech/#identity` to `https://www.it-help.tech/#organization` to match the site-wide Organization schema's `@id` anchor (set in `templates/partials/_jsonld.html:33` as `config.base_url ~ "/#organization"`). The prior `#identity` reference dangled — no element on the site emitted that anchor, so structured-data crawlers would have flagged the Offer's provider link as unresolved. Architect-flagged as Low-severity during review of the new page; applied while the file was open.
  - `templates/partials/_footer-org.html` — added `<a href="/full-day-engagements" class="ftr-link">Full-Day Engagements</a>` to the Trust column, immediately after the existing "Billing & Pricing" link. This is the *site-wide* discovery surface for the new page. Architect-flagged Medium-severity finding: a page with only one inbound internal link risks being seen as orphaned/shallow by crawlers. The footer placement gives the page a sitewide crawl path without promoting it to top-nav-level visibility — preserving the owner's "deep work, surfaced contextually, not advertised broadly" positioning while ensuring full crawlability.
  - The new page is **not** added to `[[extra.menu]]` in `config.toml` per owner direction. Top nav remains the same six items (Home / Services / Pricing / DNS Tool / Field Notes / Our Expertise) plus the Schedule CTA.
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Why: The standard $275/hour model and the new full-day model serve fundamentally different engagement shapes. Hourly billing optimizes for responsive, fragmented service across many clients per day. Full-day/multi-day pricing optimizes for sustained continuity on a single problem space — which is the working mode required for primary-source research, full-system architecture decisions, large-scale stabilization, and any engagement where ramp-up loss between sessions becomes the dominant cost. The new page makes that working style legible and sellable: it converts the right clients (those who value depth and continuity), filters out price-shoppers, justifies the pricing without explaining it defensively, and protects the firm's time and cognition. Owner-approved positioning.
- Compliance posture:
  - **CSP:** zero impact. The page contains zero inline `<style>` blocks, zero inline event handlers, and no new external origins. The `<script type="application/ld+json">` block is `application/ld+json`, not executable JavaScript, and is permitted by the existing `script-src 'self'` policy under W3C JSON-LD handling rules (browsers do not execute JSON-LD as script).
  - **Mozilla Observatory:** zero impact. No header changes, no new third-party hostnames, no policy regression.
  - **Lighthouse:** zero negative impact. Pure-text page, no images, no fonts beyond the existing site set, no client-side JS beyond the existing nav/theme toggles. The added JSON-LD block is small (~1.4 KB) and a parsed-only payload — no LCP/CLS effect.
  - **WCAG:** semantic markdown throughout (`<h1>`/`<h2>`/`<h3>`/`<ul>`/`<p>`), no color-only signals, all CTAs are real `<a>` links with descriptive anchor text. The `final-tagline` paragraph is reinforcement; the same information is conveyed in the body copy above.
  - **SEO:** new page is internally linked from `/billing/` (a high-traffic page) and includes a `Service` JSON-LD block with three nested `Offer` entries — captures structured-data ranking signals for "full-day IT consulting flat rate," "multi-day IT engagement," and similar queries. Page is reachable at `/full-day-engagements/` per the `path` frontmatter directive.
- Verification (local):
  - `zola serve` rendered the new page cleanly at `/full-day-engagements/`. Frontmatter parsed without warnings; page title, description, and skip-image/skip-author flags applied correctly.
  - Cross-link from `/billing/` clicked through to the new page; back-link from new page's Final Notes section returned to `/billing/`.
  - JSON-LD block validated structurally (well-formed; three Offer entries; correct provider @id reference).
- Architect review: requested via `architect` subagent on the diff (see commit message for advisory disposition).
- Rollback: revert this commit. New page file removal restores prior state; the cross-link addition to `billing.md` is a single-paragraph insertion that reverts cleanly. No infrastructure, CSP, or response-header changes to unwind. Branches off `bc4a6a2`.

### 2026-04-25 — Cat6 + 802.3bt PoE precision corrections in `why-your-wireless-network-sucks` cabling section
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-driven technical-accuracy review of the cabling-categories prose; AV companies cite this page as an authority and the prose needed to survive that scrutiny).
- Scope: Tighten two technical claims in the "Scientific Facts: Cabling, Bandwidth, and the Standards That Define Them" section. (1) Stop characterizing Cat6 as limited to "light PoE Type 1/2 loads" — Cat6 *can* carry IEEE 802.3bt PoE++ if the installed channel meets the electrical and thermal requirements; the right framing is design margin, not capability. (2) Distinguish PSE wattage from PD-delivered wattage on every 802.3bt citation — Type 3 = up to 60 W at PSE / ~51 W minimum at PD; Type 4 = up to 90 W at PSE / ~71 W at PD.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md`
    - Cat6 bullet (line 96): rewrote for accuracy. Replaced "Supports 10GBASE-T at limited distances (up to ~55 m under the right conditions)" with "Supports 10GBASE-T only at reduced distances — commonly cited as up to ~55 m in low-alien-crosstalk environments, and as little as ~37 m in densely bundled installations" (closer to TIA-568.2-D and the Cisco 10GBASE-T whitepaper). Replaced "Cat6 remains acceptable for legacy data-only runs, and for light PoE Type 1/2 loads when bundle and thermal limits are validated" with explicit affirmation that Cat6 *can* carry 802.3bt PoE++ when the channel meets the electrical/thermal requirements; framed the issue as design margin (24 AWG vs Cat6A's 23 AWG → more I²R heating per ampere → tighter bundle-size limits under TIA TSB-184-A's bundle-temperature-rise ceiling). Replaced the loose "Type 3 up to 60 W and Type 4 up to 90 W per port at the PSE" with the full PSE/PD pair: "Type 3 up to 60 W at the PSE (~51 W minimum delivered at the PD) and Type 4 up to 90 W at the PSE (~71 W delivered at the PD)". Characterized TSB-184-A precisely as the document whose temperature-rise data "makes Cat6A the industry-preferred minimum for high-wattage PoE bundles in modern integrator practice" — softened from an earlier draft that said TSB-184-A "recommends Cat6A," because TSB-184-A is a Technical Service Bulletin (guidelines + thermal data), and the formal Cat6A-as-minimum framing for new high-power PoE installs actually crystallizes in integrator practice and downstream standards documents (e.g., TIA-568.2-D, ISO/IEC 11801-1) that are *informed by* TSB-184-A's thermal numbers. Architect-flagged Medium-severity correction. Sharpened the red-line-text span from "do not cross" to "do not design new properties around Cat6" (matches the article's actual technical position post-correction).
    - Cat6A bullet (line 100): added the PD-delivered figure for parity — "(PoE++ up to 90 W per port at the PSE — ~71 W delivered at the PD — per IEEE 802.3bt Type 4)". Previously read "(PoE++ up to 90 W per port at the PSE per IEEE 802.3bt)".
    - Engineering-note paragraph (line 103): UNCHANGED. Already used the correct "at PSE / at PD" framing ("up to 90 W per port at the PSE (~71 W delivered at the PD per IEEE 802.3bt Type 4)") — the rest of this PR is bringing the bullets up to that same standard.
    - Footnotes [^7] (IEEE 802.3bt-2018), [^11] (ANSI/TIA-568.2-D), [^14] (TIA TSB-184-A): UNCHANGED. All three are already cited correctly with full title, year, and standards-body URL; the new prose only adds claims those footnotes already substantiate.
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Why: Owner reviewed the green-line visual change in PR #606 and used the same review pass to flag two technical inaccuracies in the adjacent prose: (a) the "light PoE Type 1/2 loads" framing was wrong — IEEE 802.3bt does not categorically restrict PoE++ from Cat6 channels; the conservative call against Cat6 for new PoE-dense builds is a *design-margin* call (smaller conductor gauge, tighter bundle-thermal headroom under TSB-184-A), not a *capability* call. (b) The article was citing only the 60 W / 90 W PSE numbers; the PD-delivered numbers (51 W / ~71 W) are the figures that actually drive load math at the device end and that AV/integrator readers expect to see when they cross-reference 802.3bt. The page is one of the most-cited technical references on the site, and AV companies look to it as the authority — being scientifically tight here is the whole point.
- Compliance posture:
  - **Lighthouse:** zero impact. Pure prose change inside an existing `<ul>` and `<span class="red-line-text">`; no new assets, no new fonts, no new layout primitives, no new resources fetched, no LCP/CLS effect.
  - **CSP:** zero impact. No inline styles introduced, no new external hosts referenced.
  - **Mozilla Observatory:** zero impact. No header changes, no new third-party origins.
  - **WCAG:** improved. The Cat6 bullet now reads with stronger logical scaffolding ("the issue is design margin, not capability"), which is easier to parse for screen readers than the prior "what it is *not*" inversion. The red-line-text span keeps its red status color, but "do not design new properties around Cat6" is information conveyed in the words themselves — color is reinforcement only, satisfying WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of Color).
  - **SEO:** small positive. Adds the precise PSE/PD wattage pair that integrators search for ("802.3bt Type 3 PD watts", "Type 4 delivered power"), and makes the page more likely to rank for "Cat6 PoE++ supported" queries that the prior loose phrasing would have missed.
- Verification (local):
  - `zola serve` rendered the section correctly; bullet list, red-line-text span, and red-line `<hr>` all render as before with the new copy.
  - Footnote refs [^7], [^11], [^14] resolve to the existing footnote definitions at the bottom of the article — no broken-reference warnings.
- Architect review: requested via `architect` subagent on the diff before push (see commit message for advisory disposition).
- Rollback: revert this commit. Pre-change state preserved in commit immediately preceding this one on `content/cat6-poe-precision-corrections`. Branches off `9ee1abb`.

### 2026-04-23 — `/brand-colors` refresh: Athenian-owl medallion + gold-led wordmark identity, demote legacy logo blue ramp
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Public brand-colors reference page (`/brand-colors`), STYLE_GUIDE top section
- Files:
  - `content/brand-colors.md`
  - `static/css/brand-colors.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Updated the brand-colors page to accurately reflect the live identity. Added a top "Brand Mark — Athenian Owl" section that displays the owl medallion (`/img/brand/owl-720.{webp,png}`) with `<picture>` + WebP/PNG fallback. Replaced the misleading "Logo Authority Blue Ramp" (no longer consumed by any selector) with "Logo Authority Gold Ramp (Athenian-Owl Banner)" — `--brand-logo-gold-top #E0C58A`, `--brand-logo-gold-mid #D2B56F`, `--brand-logo-gold-bottom #A8843E` — and noted that `--brand-logo-gold-mid` is the live fill of `.logo-it` and `.logo-help`. Demoted the blue ramp to a "Legacy" section with a clear "retained as token aliases only" pill tag at reduced opacity. Reordered the priority chip strip to lead with Logo Gold + Plus Red + gold highlight/shadow, then Action Blue + Primary Blue. Rewrote the intro and Brand Rules to make gold-led IT+HELP wordmark + owl medallion explicit. Added matching CSS for the new swatches, the brand-mark figure (circular crop, gold rim, deep shadow), the heritage section pill tag, and a `(max-width: 699px)` mobile shrink for the medallion. Updated `STYLE_GUIDE.md` top section to lead with the owl mark and gold ramp; bumped Last-updated date.
- Why: User reported the brand-colors page no longer matched the live look and feel. Investigation confirmed the IT+HELP wordmark transitioned from blue to the owl-banner gold ramp, but the page was still presenting the legacy blue ramp as the "logo authority" colors and never displayed the owl medallion at all.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`content/brand-colors-owl-gold-refresh`).

### 2026-04-23 — Homepage "How we work" 2-up imagery (on-site + remote)
- Actor: AI (owner-supplied marketing imagery: `attached_assets/on-site_*.png`, `attached_assets/remote_*.png`, both 1254×1254 PNG ~2.0–2.4 MB).
- Scope: Add a "How we work" section to the homepage with two side-by-side branded panels (On-site across San Diego / Remote anywhere). Visually communicates the two engagement modes that the existing copy hints at but never shows.
- Files:
  - `static/images/onsite-{320,512,640,960,1280}.{avif,webp}` (NEW, 10 files) and `remote-{320,512,640,960,1280}.{avif,webp}` (NEW, 10 files) — responsive variants generated from the source PNGs via ImageMagick (Lanczos resize, AVIF q=60, WebP q=80 method=6). Total payload ~1.4 MB across all 20 files; a typical mobile fetch loads only one variant in the 36–50 KB range.
  - `templates/shortcodes/picture.html` (NEW) — general-purpose responsive `<picture>` shortcode. Takes `base`, `alt`, optional `sizes` (default `(min-width: 800px) 480px, 92vw`), `width`/`height` (default 960), and `lcp` (default false → `loading="lazy" decoding="async"`). Distinct from the existing `responsive.html` shortcode, which is hardcoded for the 70px Carey avatar (`sizes="70px"`, `width=200 height=200`, `.jpg` fallback) and is left untouched.
  - `content/_index.md` — new `## How we work` section between "What we do" and "Trust signals". Two `<figure class="hww-card">` panels, each invoking `{{ picture(...) }}` with descriptive alt text and a gold-labeled caption.
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css` — `.how-we-work` grid (1-col mobile, 2-col from 800px) plus `.hww-card` styling (dark surface, gold-rule border, 1:1 aspect-ratio image, gold caption label). Print rules included for paper rendering.
- Why: The existing homepage describes services categorically (Mac, Cross-Platform, Wi-Fi, DNS) but never visually shows how the work happens. The two source images (technician walking up to a La Jolla coastal restaurant; laptop + branded mug overlooking the Pacific) reinforce both the geographic positioning ("La Jolla concierge for greater San Diego") and the dual-mode delivery (on-site + remote) without any new copy commitments.
- Compliance posture:
  - **CSP**: zero changes. `img-src self data:` already covers same-origin images in any modern format.
  - **Observatory**: zero impact (no header changes, no new hostnames, no inline anything).
  - **Lighthouse**: section is below the fold, both images are `loading="lazy" decoding="async"` with explicit `width`/`height`/`aspect-ratio` → zero LCP/CLS impact. Modern format negotiation (AVIF → WebP → WebP fallback) keeps the actual byte cost in the tens of KB on the wire.
  - **Accessibility**: descriptive alt text for both images naming the brand, the setting, and the action depicted; semantic `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` markup; gold caption label is a `<strong>` not a color-only signal.
  - **Schema.org**: no JSON-LD changes (these are decorative content imagery, not Product/Service hero images).
- Verification:
  - `zola build` clean, 12 pages + 1 section, 457 ms.
  - Rendered HTML inspected: both `<picture>` tags emitted, srcset format matches the existing `carey-*` set convention, lazy-loading attributes present.
  - Live preview screenshot confirmed: 2-up panel renders correctly on desktop with the dark card surface, gold border, and gold caption label.
- Rollback: revert this commit. No infra, CSP, response-headers, or external-service changes to unwind.


### 2026-04-20 — CSP hardening to clear Mozilla Observatory v5 score 145 (A+) and dispose of federal Qualys CWE-201 false positives
- Actor: AI (owner-directed remediation, architect-consulted plan, Task #23).
- Trigger: Two convergent inputs:
  1. Mozilla Observatory v5 baseline scan 92744651 (2026-04-20) reported grade A+ but score 140 — three remaining "missing modern hardening" deductions all addressable via additional CSP directives. Audit gate `infra/audit/audit.config.json` sat at `minScore: 120`, masking the regression headroom.
  2. Federal Qualys vulnerability scan reported 11 findings on `www.it-help.tech` — all QID 150059 (CWE-201, "Information Exposure Through Sent Data"), every single one triggered by the literal string `C:\>` in `content/services.md` line 403 (the cross-platform fluency copy). The QID is a regex-based path-leak heuristic; the literal is intentional editorial content describing shell prompts (`$`, `#`, `C:\>`). Other 4 hostnames in the scan (subdomains operated by separate owners) are explicitly out of scope.
- Architect consultation: confirmed CSP must be regenerated through `infra/cloudfront/generate_policy.py` (the canonical generator), NOT by hand-editing `csp-policy-v1.json` — the JSON is rebuilt from `public/**/*.html` on every deploy via `infra/cloudfront/update_policy.sh`, so a direct JSON edit would be silently overwritten on next push. Approved 4 net-new directives for `build_site_csp()`. Explicitly REJECTED adding `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` — it broke Safari on 2026-04-17 (per-S3-object CORP headers must be deployed to every asset object first; that is a separate, larger workstream tracked outside this PR).
- Files:
  - `infra/cloudfront/generate_policy.py` — `build_site_csp()` adds 4 directives and tightens 1: `form-action 'self'` → `form-action 'none'` (no `<form>` on the marketing site posts anywhere — verified by grep), plus new `worker-src 'none'`, `require-trusted-types-for 'script'`, and `trusted-types 'none'`. The Trusted Types pair disables every DOM-XSS sink (`innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `document.write`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `eval`, `new Function`, …) at the browser layer. Pre-flight grep across `static/js/*.{js,min.js}` and `themes/abridge/static/js/*.{js,min.js}` returned ZERO matches for any of those sinks, so the policy is purely defensive — it cannot break our shipped JS because none of it touches a sink. Added a 12-line comment block above the directive list documenting the rationale, the deliberate COEP omission, and the audit date so the next maintainer sees the reasoning without spelunking through git log.
  - `infra/cloudfront/csp-policy-v1.json` — regenerated by running `zola build && python3 infra/cloudfront/generate_policy.py --mode site`. Final CSP length 337 bytes (well under the 2048-byte CloudFront safety guard, and under typical 4096-byte HTTP-header advisory limits). 0 inline-script hashes and 0 inline-style hashes (Sub-4 externalization landed earlier — all inline `<script>` and `<style>` blocks are now external files served from `'self'`, so the hash allowlist is empty and the policy stays small).
  - `infra/audit/audit.config.json` — `observatory.minScore: 120` → `145`. The deploy gate (`infra/audit/run-observatory.mjs`) will now fail any future deploy that regresses below 145, locking in the new floor. Score 145 is the architect-approved target for v5 algorithm; the next bump would be to whatever a successful post-deploy scan returns.
  - `content/services.md` — UNCHANGED. The `C:\>` literal in line 403 is intentional cross-platform fluency copy ("the same instinct for reading logs, tracing packets, and reasoning from evidence applies whether the prompt is `$`, `#`, or `C:\>`"). Architect-approved disposition: accept the 11 Qualys CWE-201 findings as documented false positives. The QID 150059 heuristic flags any string matching common Windows path patterns; our use is editorial, not a leaked filesystem path. Changing the copy to dodge the regex would compromise the writing without addressing any real vulnerability.
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Verification (local, pre-deploy):
  - `zola build` — clean, 344ms, 12 pages + 1 section.
  - `python3 infra/cloudfront/generate_policy.py --mode site` — clean, 0 script hashes, 0 style hashes, CSP length 337 bytes.
  - Generated CSP string (verbatim): `default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'none'; worker-src 'none'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; media-src 'self'; manifest-src 'self'; require-trusted-types-for 'script'; trusted-types 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests`
  - Post-merge verification (will run automatically on the GitHub Actions deploy job): `infra/audit/run-observatory.mjs` triggers a fresh Observatory scan against `www.it-help.tech` and gates the deploy on `grade >= A+` AND `score >= 145`. If the new CSP doesn't move the score to ≥145, the deploy fails loudly and the audit threshold lock prevents a silent regression.
- Risk assessment:
  - **Low — Trusted Types breakage.** Static-site JS audited; zero DOM sinks anywhere. The directives only enforce policy-creation for sinks that are never called.
  - **Low — form-action breakage.** Site has zero `<form>` elements. (Schedule/booking goes through an external link to `schedule.it-help.tech`, not an HTML form.)
  - **Low — worker-src breakage.** Site ships zero Web Workers / Service Workers / Shared Workers.
  - **Medium — score still <145 after deploy.** If Observatory v5 weights these directives differently than expected and the score lands at, say, 142, the deploy gate fails and we either (a) lower the threshold pragmatically or (b) add the next directive(s) the scan calls out. Either resolution is a one-line follow-up PR.
- Rollback: revert this commit. Pre-change state: CSP without the 4 added/tightened directives, audit gate at minScore 120, Observatory grade A+ score 140. The `C:\>` editorial line in `content/services.md` is unchanged in both directions.

### 2026-04-19 — Site-wide Schema.org JSON-LD: auto-emitted Organization + Article + BreadcrumbList + Blog from a single partial
- Actor: AI (owner-directed remediation β following the architect-driven discovery that 3 of 6 field-notes shipped zero structured data).
- Trigger: Whole-repo audit revealed JSON-LD coverage was inconsistent — `dns-security`, `mac-cybersecurity`, and `wireless` had hand-written `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks embedded in their markdown bodies, while `apple-sends-you-to-ijail`, `hack-your-engrams-to-remember-passwords`, and `it-problem-solving-scientific-method` had none. Initial scratchpad diagnosis (that `templates/macros/seo.html` was missing and `{% block seo %}` was unwired) was wrong: the file exists in the abridge theme via inheritance, and the `{% block seo %}` definitions in `page.html`/`field-notes.html` are dead code because `base.html` defines no parent block. Real SEO source of truth is `templates/partials/head.html`, which generates title/meta/OG/Twitter from frontmatter but emitted **zero** JSON-LD. So the gap was: no automatic structured-data layer existed at all; coverage came entirely from per-author markdown body discipline.
- Files:
  - `templates/partials/_jsonld.html` (NEW) — single source of truth. Emits Organization (every page, with stable `@id` anchor for graph linking), plus Article (or TechArticle via `extra.schema_type`) + BreadcrumbList on field-notes posts, plus Blog on the field-notes section index. All values driven from frontmatter (`page.title`, `page.description`, `page.date`, `page.updated`, `page.extra.og_image`/`extra.image`, `page.extra.author`, `page.permalink`). Strings routed through Tera's `json_encode` filter so apostrophes/em-dashes/quotes serialize as valid JSON automatically. Opt-out via `page.extra.skip_auto_jsonld = true` for any page that wants to suppress the auto-emitted Article block (defensive escape hatch; not used by any current page).
  - `templates/partials/head.html` — added `{% include "partials/_jsonld.html" %}` directly before the `head_extra` injection point so structured data ships with every rendered page.
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Build verification (local `zola build`, every JSON-LD block parsed with stdlib `json.loads`):
  - apple-sends-you-to-ijail: 0 → 3 blocks `[Organization, Article, BreadcrumbList]`
  - hack-your-engrams-to-remember-passwords: 0 → 3 blocks `[Organization, Article, BreadcrumbList]`
  - it-problem-solving-scientific-method: 0 → 3 blocks `[Organization, Article, BreadcrumbList]`
  - dns-security-best-practices: 3 → 6 blocks (3 new auto + 3 hand-curated TechArticle/FAQPage/HowTo retained)
  - mac-cybersecurity-threats: 1 → 4 blocks (3 new auto + existing TechArticle retained)
  - why-your-wireless-network-sucks: 1 → 4 blocks (3 new auto + existing TechArticle retained)
  - field-notes section index: 0 → 2 blocks `[Organization, Blog]`
  - All other pages (home, about, services): pre-existing rich JSON-LD intact, plus the new Organization baseline (consistent `@id` link target across the site).
  - All blocks parsed cleanly. No Tera template errors. Build time 498ms.
- Why duplicate Organization/Article on hand-curated pages is intentional: Google supports multiple JSON-LD blocks per page (they are merged into a single graph), and the consistent `@id` anchor on Organization lets crawlers de-duplicate the publisher entity across all blocks. Removing the hand-written blocks from the 3 curated markdowns is a separate, lower-priority cleanup deferred to a follow-up PR — keeping them avoids any risk of regression in the rich types (HowTo, FAQPage) that the auto layer doesn't yet emit.
- Why `_jsonld.html` and not a Tera macro: includes execute in the `page`/`section` template context automatically (no need to pass them as macro arguments through every call site), and adding to a partial is a one-line wire-up vs. modifying every template that extends `base.html`.
- CSP compatibility: production `style-src 'self'` is unaffected — JSON-LD ships in `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags, which fall under `script-src` (which already permits inline + same-origin per the existing CSP).
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`feat/jsonld-structured-data`), baseline commit on main pre-merge.

### 2026-04-19 — Google Indexing API integration (keyless OIDC, shared URL collector with IndexNow)
- Actor: AI (owner-directed remediation following the architect-driven discovery that no Google Indexing code existed in the repo despite the GCP-side WIF setup being in place).
- Trigger: Earlier sessions documented "tasks #21/#22 merged" for Google Indexing, but a direct check of the repo confirmed the truth: the GCP/Search-Console plumbing was real (Workload Identity Pool `github-actions-pool`, OIDC provider `github-oidc`, SA `id-web-search-indexing-api@it-help-indexing.iam.gserviceaccount.com` bound to repo `IT-Help-San-Diego/it-help-tech-site`, SA owner of `https://www.it-help.tech/` in Search Console, repo Variables `GCP_WIF_PROVIDER` + `GCP_INDEXING_SA_EMAIL`), but **no GitHub Actions job, no Python script, and no `infra/google-indexing/` directory ever landed on `main`**. GitHub code search confirmed: zero occurrences of `indexing.googleapis.com` in the repo before this commit. So the keyless auth was dangling — provisioned but unused. This PR connects the wire.
- Architect consultation: rejected initial design of subprocess-piping (option A — fragile stdout contract) and per-script duplication (option C — drift risk). Adopted option B: extract URL-diff logic into a shared module so both notifiers consume the same source of truth. Adopted minimal-deps auth (option C from Q2): use the official `google-github-actions/auth` action to mint a short-lived access token, then have the Python script use stdlib `urllib` with that token — no `pip install` step, no hand-rolled OAuth exchange.
- Files:
  - **NEW** `infra/indexing/__init__.py` (package marker).
  - **NEW** `infra/indexing/urlset.py` — single source of truth for URL collection. Exports `Notification` dataclass (`url`, `type` ∈ `URL_UPDATED` | `URL_DELETED`), `ZERO_SHA`, `run_git`, `parse_frontmatter`, `file_at_ref`, `path_to_url_path`, `parent_section_url`, `changed_files`, `url_for_page`, `resolve_before` (now also guards against unreachable BEFORE SHAs from force-pushes via `git cat-file -e`), `fallback_notifications` (homepage + sitemap.xml when BEFORE is unreachable), and `collect_notifications` (typed equivalent of the old `collect_urls`). Ren­ames-from emit `URL_DELETED`; their parent-section listing emits `URL_UPDATED` (the listing still exists, just with one fewer item).
  - **REFACTORED** `infra/indexnow/submit.py` — dropped from 369 → 152 lines. Now just IndexNow-specific concerns: the wire payload (`host`/`key`/`keyLocation`/`urlList`), the POST + step-summary writer, and the `main()` glue. URL collection delegated to `urlset.collect_notifications` and flattened to bare URLs (IndexNow's wire format does not distinguish update vs delete). Output of `--dry-run HEAD~3 HEAD …` byte-identical to pre-refactor: same 4 URLs.
  - **NEW** `infra/google-indexing/submit.py` — reuses the same shared collector. Auth: reads `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` (set by `google-github-actions/auth` with `export_environment_variables: true`). Posts each URL serially to `https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications:publish` with body `{url, type}`. Caps at `MAX_URLS_PER_RUN = 50` (defensive — Google quota is 200/day). Force-push fallback: when `resolve_before` returns None, submits homepage + sitemap.xml as `URL_UPDATED` so a force-push still triggers a crawl hint instead of silent no-op. Per-URL status table written to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. Always exits 0 on network/auth/quota failures; missing token writes a clear skip-summary.
  - **MODIFIED** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — added `google-indexing-ping` job after `indexnow-ping`. `if: github.event_name == 'push'`, `needs: deploy`, `continue-on-error: true`, `permissions: { contents: read, id-token: write }` (the `id-token: write` is the GitHub-side half of the WIF handshake — without it the OIDC token is never issued). Preflight step checks `vars.GCP_WIF_PROVIDER` and `vars.GCP_INDEXING_SA_EMAIL`; if either is unset, writes a clear skip-summary and short-circuits all subsequent steps via `if: steps.preflight.outputs.configured == 'true'`. Uses `google-github-actions/auth@7c6bc770dae815cd3e89ee6cdf493a5fab2cc093` (v3 latest, pinned by SHA per the repo convention) with scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/indexing` and `token_format: access_token`. Then runs the Python script with the same `BEFORE`/`AFTER`/`HOST` arguments as IndexNow.
  - **MODIFIED** `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Architectural risks pre-empted (architect severity ranking):
  - **High — URL-list drift:** addressed by the shared `urlset` module. A bug fix to the URL semantics now propagates to both notifiers atomically; you cannot ship a state where IndexNow sees a different URL set than Google.
  - **High — auth miswiring causing silent non-operation:** addressed by the explicit preflight + skip-summary. Either the variables are set and we attempt auth (and the workflow log shows the result), or they're not set and the summary tells you exactly which variable is missing. There is no third state where the job appears green while doing nothing.
  - **Medium — force-push diff failures:** addressed by the new reachability check in `resolve_before` (`git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}`) plus the `fallback_notifications` (homepage + sitemap.xml). A force-push now still pings 2 URLs instead of silently skipping.
  - **Medium — quota burn from accidental broad diffs:** addressed by the `MAX_URLS_PER_RUN = 50` cap with a `::warning::` annotation when truncation happens. Google's daily quota is 200; we burn at most 25% per run.
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile infra/indexing/urlset.py infra/indexnow/submit.py infra/google-indexing/submit.py` — all clean.
  - `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/deploy.yml'))"` — clean.
  - `python3 infra/indexnow/submit.py HEAD~3 HEAD www.it-help.tech dummykey --dry-run` — outputs the same 4 URLs as before the refactor (no behavior regression).
  - `python3 infra/google-indexing/submit.py HEAD~3 HEAD www.it-help.tech --dry-run` — outputs the same 4 URLs typed as `URL_UPDATED`.
  - End-to-end auth handshake will be verified on the next push to `main` (auto-runs the new job). If the WIF setup is correct, the Authenticate step turns green; if Search Console permission is missing, we'll see a 403 in the per-URL status table and can fix the property-Owner grant without a code change.
- Out of scope (explicit non-goals): no JSON-LD work (deferred remediation β), no meta-description trimming (deferred remediation γ), no taxonomy template work (deliberate per the prior 2026-04-19 health-check entry).
- Rollback: revert this commit. Pre-change state: GCP/Search-Console plumbing existed but was inert; only IndexNow ran on push. Reverting restores that state without breaking IndexNow (the refactored `infra/indexnow/submit.py` would also be reverted to its 369-line monolithic form, which is functionally equivalent).

### 2026-04-19 — Stop pinging dead /tags/ + /categories/ URLs to search engines + fix three stale sitemap dates
- Actor: AI (owner-directed, whole-repo health check)
- Trigger: Owner asked for an end-to-end repo health check ("make sure that all the meta data matches, the site maps are clean, the links we've communicated and we're not spamming or bothering anybody, but we're best practices from every angle and we can be picked up by the robots correctly"). The architect review surfaced two real problems that directly violated the owner's stated "no spamming" + "sitemaps clean" requirements:
  1. **404-URL spam to search engines.** `config.toml` declares `[[taxonomies]]` for `categories` and `tags`, but the repo has **no taxonomy template** (`templates/taxonomy_list.html` and `templates/taxonomy_single.html` do not exist). Zola silently does not generate `/tags/`, `/categories/`, `/tags/<slug>/`, or `/categories/<slug>/` pages. Verified: `find public -type d -name tags -o -type d -name categories` returns nothing. Meanwhile `infra/indexnow/submit.py` (the architect-required taxonomy expansion from PR #589, commits `0cb7a1f`, `f653c2a`, `29a8c2e`) was submitting all those URLs on every content push, and `infra/google-indexing/submit.py` was reusing that URL list via `--print-urls-only`. Net effect: every push pinged Bing / Yandex / Naver / Yep / Seznam.cz / Google with URLs that returned 404. That is exactly what the owner asked us to avoid.
  2. **Sitemap `<lastmod>` stale by ~11 months for 3 of 6 articles.** Three field-notes (`dns-security-best-practices.md`, `mac-cybersecurity-threats.md`, `why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md`) used a `last_modified:` frontmatter field that **Zola does not recognize**. Zola only honors `updated:`. The sitemap template (`templates/sitemap.xml`) correctly checks `entry.updated` then falls back to `entry.date` — the data was just in the wrong field. Search engines look at `<lastmod>` to decide whether to re-crawl. We were telling them three of our six articles hadn't changed in 11 months when they had been rewritten 5 days ago.
- Files: `infra/indexnow/submit.py` (153 lines removed: deleted `slugify()`, `read_taxonomy_names()`, the YAML/TOML taxonomy parser inside `parse_frontmatter()`, the three taxonomy emission blocks inside `collect_urls()`, the `--config` arg, and the `taxonomy_names` parameter; updated module docstring to explain the deliberate omission and how to revert), `content/field-notes/dns-security-best-practices.md` (`last_modified:` → `updated:`), `content/field-notes/mac-cybersecurity-threats.md` (same), `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md` (same), `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`.
- Architectural choice — delete vs. gate the taxonomy code: kept the dead code reference in the module docstring (pointing at git history) rather than retaining unreachable functions behind a flag. Dead-code-with-a-comment is a smell; documented-deletion-with-a-revert-pointer is the cleaner long-term posture. If we ever build proper taxonomy browse pages (which would need `taxonomy_list.html` + `taxonomy_single.html` plus a UX decision about /tags/ landing-page design), this commit is the one to revert for the URL emission half.
- Cross-system propagation: `infra/google-indexing/submit.py` consumes the IndexNow URL list via `infra/indexnow/submit.py --print-urls-only` (the single-source-of-truth architectural decision documented in the Google Indexing API entry below). Because that contract is preserved, the Google Indexing job automatically inherits the "no taxonomy URLs" behavior with zero edits to its own code.
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile infra/indexnow/submit.py` clean.
  - `python3 infra/indexnow/submit.py --help` shows the simplified arg surface (no more `--config`).
  - `python3 infra/indexnow/submit.py HEAD~3 HEAD www.it-help.tech dummykey --dry-run` against a real diff range computes 4 URLs (1 page + 1 parent section + 1 sibling page + homepage) — **zero `/tags/` or `/categories/` URLs in the output**.
  - `zola build` clean. `public/sitemap.xml` now shows `<lastmod>2026-04-19</lastmod>` for all three previously-stale articles (verified: `dns-security-best-practices`, `mac-cybersecurity-threats`, `why-your-wireless-network-sucks`).
  - The other 3 field-notes (apple-ijail, hack-engrams, it-problem-solving) already used `updated:` correctly and are unaffected.
- Out of scope (queued for follow-up):
  - Wiring up the dead `{% block seo %}` in `templates/base.html` so `templates/page.html` and `templates/field-notes.html` per-page SEO overrides actually render (3 of 6 field-notes currently have zero JSON-LD; the macro `macros_seo::seo` referenced by `page.html:30` doesn't exist either — needs to be written).
  - Trimming oversized meta descriptions (5 of 6 field-notes exceed Google's ~160-char SERP threshold; wireless is at 336) and the wireless title (88 chars).
  - Removing redundant `extra.canonical_url` overrides (Zola auto-emits canonical from page permalink; manual override only earns its keep when canonical needs to differ from permalink).
  - Building actual taxonomy templates if browse-by-tag is ever desired (with 6 articles total this has low UX value today).
- Rollback: revert this commit. Pre-change state: indexnow + google-indexing submitted /tags/ /categories/ URLs that 404'd in production; sitemap showed stale lastmod for 3 articles. Reverting restores both behaviors.

### 2026-04-19 — Audit hygiene: Ahrefs alt-text false-positive suppression + IndexNow integration (combined PR)
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-directed)
- Trigger: Owner shared a 12-CSV Ahrefs site audit (UTF-16 LE export). Triage classified each finding:
  - `Warning-Missing_alt_text` + `Warning-Missing_alt_text-links` — **false positive.** Auditor flagged `wordmark-banner.png` (every page, in topbar) and `owl-720.png` (homepage hero) as missing alt. Both are intentionally `alt=""` per WCAG 2.1 SC 1.1.1 (Decorative Images): the wordmark sits inside `<a aria-label="IT Help San Diego — home">` (parent link names the brand; img must NOT add a second name or screen readers double-announce), and the owl sits inside `<div class="brand-mark" aria-hidden="true">` (entire branch hidden from a11y tree). WAI Tutorials canonical pattern: "Logo Image as Link" → `alt=""` plus optional `role="presentation"` for tooling. **Action: this PR.** Added `role="presentation"` to both imgs as the documented hint to non-WCAG-aware crawlers; `alt=""` preserved exactly as-is. No accessibility-tree change, no rendered-output change, no CSS change.
  - `Notice-HTTP_to_HTTPS_redirect` + `Warning-3XX_redirect` — **expected behavior, not a defect.** Single row each: `http://www.it-help.tech/` → 301 → `https://www.it-help.tech/`. Required for HSTS-preloaded sites and every modern security baseline. Auditor flags every 3XX regardless of intent. No action.
  - `Notice-indexable-H1_tag_changed` + `Notice-indexable-Meta_description_changed` — **owner-intentional.** H1 is "We solve tech problems. No monthly retainers." and meta description was revised in prior PRs. Informational; no action.
  - `Notice-indexable-Page_has_only_one_dofollow_incoming_internal_link` — **auditor crawl-limit artifact.** Flagged `/` and `/about/` as having only 1 dofollow inlink, but the site-wide topbar nav (`templates/base.html:90`) and footer (`_footer-org.html:103,117`) link to `/about/` from every page. The audit's own alt-text-links CSV explicitly notes "Internal pages crawl limit reached" — the auditor stopped before it found the rest. No action.
  - `Notice-No._of_referring_domains_dropped`, `Notice-Organic_traffic_dropped`, `Notice-Pages_dropped_from_Top_10` — **off-site signals.** Real business observations but not addressable from inside the repo. Marketing/PR work.
  - `Notice-Pages_to_submit_to_IndexNow` — **action: this PR.** Listed `/` and `/about/` for IndexNow submission. Owner approved wiring up the protocol (see below).
- Files: `templates/base.html`, `templates/partials/hero_logo.html`, `static/d6ff22bcff9d13ff0628919ec002cfa60387f3900ef201f5abfc28ab24f8361d.txt` (NEW — IndexNow verification key file), `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (new `indexnow-ping` job), `AGENTS.md` (one-line addition under Deploy & Build Pipeline), `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`.
- IndexNow protocol summary (for future-agent reference):
  - Open instant-indexing protocol, IETF draft (`draft-indexnow-protocol`), published spec at https://www.indexnow.org/documentation. Co-developed by Microsoft Bing and Yandex.
  - **Honored by**: Bing (Microsoft), Yandex, Seznam.cz, Naver, Yep (Brave's index). **Not honored by**: Google (uses its own URL Inspection / Indexing API). Therefore IndexNow is purely additive to our existing sitemap.xml — Google posture is unaffected.
  - **Why this matters here**: Edge-on-Windows defaults to Bing. Owner has Windows-only customers and explicitly wants the site discoverable to Windows users; faster Bing indexing serves that.
  - **Verification handshake**: a public key file at `https://<host>/<key>.txt` containing only the key. The key is intentionally public-by-design — search engines verify ownership by GET-ing that URL; treating it as a secret breaks the handshake. Spec allows 8–128 chars, hex/alphanumeric/dashes. We use 64-char `openssl rand -hex 32`. Current key: `d6ff22bcff9d13ff0628919ec002cfa60387f3900ef201f5abfc28ab24f8361d`. Rotate by generating a new hex string with `openssl rand -hex 32`, replacing the file in `static/` (delete old, add new), and updating `INDEXNOW_KEY` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The next push that touches `content/**/*.md` will publish the new key file and ping with the new key.
  - **Anti-spam guarantees in our implementation** (these are the architectural reasons it cannot become spammy):
    1. Diff-driven — `git diff $BEFORE..$AFTER -- 'content/**/*.md'` enumerates only files that actually changed in this push. No content change → no ping.
    2. Owned-host-only — submits only `https://www.it-help.tech/...` URLs (the same host as the key file). The IndexNow spec requires the key file's host to match every URL submitted; cross-host submissions are rejected.
    3. Drafts filtered — frontmatter `draft = true` / `draft: true` files are skipped before submission.
    4. Batched — one POST per push, up to spec maximum of 10,000 URLs (we typically submit 0–3).
    5. Daily quota: spec recommends ≤10,000 URLs/day/host; our typical deploy is well under that.
    6. Failure-isolated — `continue-on-error: true` and not in the `audit` job's `needs` chain, so a network blip on `api.indexnow.org` cannot fail a deploy or regress the 98/A+/120 audit gate.
- WCAG citation for the alt-text decision: W3C WAI Tutorials, "Decorative Images — Image Used as a Link with Adjacent Text" and "Logo Image as a Link" (canonical pattern: `<a aria-label="..."><img alt=""></a>`; the img must contribute no accessible name). `role="presentation"` (and its ARIA 1.1 synonym `role="none"`) is the documented additional hint for tooling that doesn't honor empty alt as the presentational signal. Both choices are equivalent at the accessibility-tree layer; `role="presentation"` is the older / wider-recognized name and what crawler heuristics most commonly look for.
- Verification:
  - `zola build` clean; `static/<key>.txt` reaches `public/<key>.txt` as a top-level artifact (Zola copies the entire `static/` tree).
  - Rendered homepage and about page HTML show `role="presentation"` on both target imgs and `alt=""` is preserved (NOT replaced with text).
  - URL-mapping logic dry-run confirmed against synthetic diffs: `content/_index.md` → `https://www.it-help.tech/`, `content/services.md` → `https://www.it-help.tech/services/`, `content/field-notes/<slug>.md` → `https://www.it-help.tech/field-notes/<slug>/`. Drafts skipped.
- Architect review (3 passes, all on this PR):
  - Pass 1 (commit 02ab150): BLOCKING — `git diff -- 'content/**/*.md'` missed top-level files (`content/_index.md`, `content/about.md`, etc.) because git's default pathspec does NOT treat `**` as recursive. MAJOR — missing taxonomy URL coverage, missing parent-section URL, `--diff-filter=AM` ignored deletes/renames. MINOR — hardcoded host. Decision: extracted Python from inline YAML heredoc to `infra/indexnow/submit.py` (matches `infra/audit/`, `infra/llms/` pattern).
  - Pass 2 (commit c681b38): BLOCKING fix verified (`:(glob)content/**/*.md`). MAJORs all fixed (taxonomy union over BEFORE+AFTER frontmatter, parent-section inference, `--diff-filter=AMDR` with name-status). NEW BLOCKING surfaced: YAML inline-list scalar regex `r'\"([^\"]+)\"|\'([^\']+)\'|([\\w-]+)'` greedy-tokenized multi-word terms — `tags: [Apple Account, password reset]` became `['Apple','Account','password','reset']`. Real production exposure: `apple-sends-you-to-ijail.md` tags every entry was wrong. Two NEW MINORs (slugify non-ASCII, M-to-draft taxonomy root).
  - Pass 3 (commit f653c2a): NEW BLOCKING fixed by switching to top-level comma-split + per-item quote-strip. M-to-draft taxonomy root MINOR fixed. Slugify-non-ASCII left as documented future-risk (no current ASCII-only exposure). Architect note: `split(",")` is not quote-comma-aware, but no current production tag/category contains a literal comma; tracked as follow-up. **Approved for merge.**
- Why one combined PR: owner explicitly requested it. Both items are audit-triggered hygiene improvements with independent code paths (templates vs. workflow + static file); combining keeps the audit-narrative coherent in one place.
- Out of scope (deliberate): off-site SEO recovery (referring domains, organic traffic, Top-10 reclamation — marketing work, not repo work); Google Indexing API integration (different protocol, can be a future task); changes to existing alt text on content images in articles; CSP / headers / audit-gate threshold changes; `replit.md` (governed by stub guard); reopening or amending any other PR.
- Rollback: revert this PR. Pre-PR state at `314d821` on `main`.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note correction (Mac cybersecurity, post-#585 merge): strengthen ManageEngine positioning paragraph, strike Mobile Device Manager Plus reference, add Apple Business Manager / supervision-erase nuance
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-directed)
- Trigger: Owner reviewed merged PR #585 and identified two further problems with the Mac article. (1) The MTD section's first bullet — "ManageEngine Mobile Device Manager Plus / Endpoint Central mobile module" — is wrong; owner does not offer Mobile Device Manager Plus as a separate product. He runs **ManageEngine Endpoint Central Security Edition only**, which is the entire product, no lower or higher SKU. (2) The "Disclosure on positioning" paragraph in Layer 2 is *still* doing apologetic-weakening work after the #585 cleanup. Specific phrases owner objected to: "operational honesty rather than salesmanship" (reads as "this is just what I happen to have, brah"), "realistic threat tiers most San Diego clients face" (his roster includes pop-star clients — this is top-of-food-chain protection, not a fallback), "for clients who don't need that posture" (more weakening — implies his clients are second-tier; they are not). Owner also wanted: explicit acknowledgment that the closing of the capability gap is real on both sides (ManageEngine has caught up, *and* Apple has closed even more of it from underneath through the Apple Business Manager consolidation), plus the supervision/erase nuance for high-profile personal devices (pop stars will not accept a phone that can be wiped on a policy push, so deep ABM supervision is deliberately not pushed — that is a real-world deployment constraint, not a defense gap).
- Files: `content/field-notes/mac-cybersecurity-threats.md`, `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`.
- Three surgical edits:
  - **Layer 2 (ManageEngine) "Disclosure on positioning" paragraph — full rewrite of the second half.** Reframed the recommendation rationale from "operational honesty rather than salesmanship" to "**economic and engineering reality, not a hedge**" with the explicit explanation that the Zimperium five-figure-buy-in plus device-count floor is "*not a 'most clients don't need that posture' problem — it is a 'no commercial small-to-mid client is writing that check' problem,*" extended to name the high-profile/entertainment-industry clients on the roster and to note that "*management companies would not authorize the spend even if the client wanted it.*" Added the headline framing: "**top-of-the-food-chain protection on its own merits**: the high-profile clients on it are protected, full stop." Added the bilateral capability-gap statement: "*ManageEngine Security Edition has closed considerably in recent years, and Apple itself has closed even more of it from underneath through the Apple Business Manager (ABM) consolidation work shipped recently.*" Added the parenthetical supervision/erase disclosure: "*for client iPhones we deliberately do not push the deepest ABM supervision, because supervision carries an erase-on-policy-push risk and a high-profile personal device is not a phone you can wipe; that is a real-world deployment constraint, not a defense gap.*" Recovered the maintenance-overhead point but reframed it positively: "*the practical kicker is that this stack runs at a fraction of the maintenance overhead of a true enterprise EDR, which means the protection is what is actually being applied day to day rather than what is theoretically licensed and quietly drifting out of policy.*" Removed every instance of weakening qualifier ("realistic threat tiers", "clients who don't need that posture", "operational honesty rather than salesmanship").
  - **MTD section ("Mobile Threat Defense (when warranted)") first bullet — full rewrite.** Struck the "ManageEngine Mobile Device Manager Plus / Endpoint Central mobile module" framing entirely (we do not offer MDM Plus as a separate product). Replaced with: "**ManageEngine Endpoint Central Security Edition** — already covers managed mobile devices in the same single agent that runs on the Mac fleet. There is no separate 'mobile module' to up-sell and no lower or higher SKU; **Security Edition is the whole product**." Added the institutional-vs-personal ABM context with explicit cross-reference to the supervision/erase note in Layer 2.
  - **MTD section Zimperium bullet trailing line.** Updated "for everyone else, ManageEngine's mobile module is sufficient" to "for everyone else, ManageEngine Endpoint Central Security Edition already covers it" — consistency fix to remove the residual "mobile module" reference.
- No new factual claims requiring architect re-review — these are voice/positioning/product-name corrections within an already-architect-reviewed article.
- Why "wipe-on-policy-push risk" rather than enumerating specific MDM commands: the supervision-side risk is real and well-documented (supervised devices can be remotely wiped via MDM commands and via the ABM unenrollment-erase workflow), but the article does not need to enumerate the exact mechanism to make the deployment-constraint point. Keeping it at the descriptive level avoids both an MDM tutorial and the risk of misstating the precise ABM/MDM erase semantics, which have changed across recent iOS versions.
- Verification: build clean, post serves 200, all eight phrase checks pass exactly (1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0): new phrases rendered ("economic and engineering reality"=1, "top-of-the-food-chain"=1, "Apple Business Manager"=2, "wipe-on-policy-push"=1, "Security Edition is the whole product"=1); offending phrases gone ("ManageEngine Mobile Device Manager Plus"=0, "operational honesty rather than salesmanship"=0, "for clients who don't need that posture"=0).
- Post-merge race note: PR #585 merged at 08:39:11Z. New branch is freshly off `origin/main` after that merge — clean.
- Rollback: revert the upcoming PR; prior text recoverable from git history at `049d79d`.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note correction (Mac cybersecurity, post-#584 merge): strike unsupported "better than ManageEngine on certain enterprise dimensions" claim, add Zimperium five-figure-buy-in operational reality
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-directed)
- Trigger: Owner reviewed merged PR #584 and flagged the "Disclosure on positioning" paragraph in the ManageEngine layer as overstated. Specifically: the phrase "Zimperium MTD, SentinelOne, and CrowdStrike Falcon are also excellent — **better than ManageEngine on certain enterprise dimensions**" was not defensible — owner's lived experience is that the gap has closed considerably and there is not much Zimperium did three years ago that ManageEngine cannot do today. Separately, the Zimperium iPhone-MTD entry needed the operational reality stated: owner has set up Zimperium portals and knows the team, but the commercial entry point is well into five figures with a substantial mobile-device-count floor, which is the actual reason it is not in the Magic Combo for typical small-to-mid commercial clients (economic, not technical).
- Files: `content/field-notes/mac-cybersecurity-threats.md`, `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`.
- Two surgical edits:
  - Layer 2 ("ManageEngine") disclosure paragraph — struck the "better than ManageEngine on certain enterprise dimensions" framing entirely; reframed the three named products (Zimperium / SentinelOne / CrowdStrike) as "serious products in their own contexts" with explicit role separation (Zimperium = federal-posture mobile, SentinelOne + CrowdStrike = full enterprise EDR); added the closing line that the gap between ManageEngine Security Edition and the more famous enterprise names has closed considerably and there is not much the heavy-tier products did three years ago that ManageEngine cannot do today.
  - iPhone protection / Mobile Threat Defense → Zimperium bullet — kept the federal-grade framing (FedRAMP, CDM APL, DoD contracts) and added the intel-feed callback ("when a high-profile mobile compromise hits the news, Zimperium is often the vendor that named the family in their customers' inboxes the night before" — recovers the spirit of the original article's "early morning email from Zimperium saying 'We got you, don't worry'" line in the new structure). Then added owner's personal experience ("I have set up Zimperium portals and know the team there") and the operational-honesty buy-in disclosure ("the commercial entry point is well into five figures and assumes a substantial mobile-device-count floor, which puts it out of reach for typical small-to-mid commercial clients regardless of how appealing the federal-posture story is"). Closed with: "For clients with a federal posture requirement and the fleet to match, Zimperium is the right answer and we will happily stand up the portal; for everyone else, ManageEngine's mobile module is sufficient."
- Why "well into five figures" rather than a specific dollar figure: owner stated "$50,000 buy-in" verbally and "I think you need to buy 50,000 mobile devices as their minimum" with the "I think" disclaimer. Both numbers are owner's lived recollection and may have shifted since he last priced it. Committing a specific dollar amount or device count to the article would create a maintenance liability if Zimperium repackaged. "Well into five figures" + "substantial mobile-device-count floor" captures the operational reality (typical small-to-mid client cannot afford it) without committing to a specific figure that could age badly or be challenged.
- No architect re-review — these are surgical text replacements within an already-architect-reviewed article, no new factual claims introduced (the buy-in characterization is owner's lived experience, not a citable statistic).
- Post-merge race note: PR #584 was merged by owner (`e060fae`) while this correction was being prepared. New PR is freshly branched from `origin/main` after that merge — clean.
- Verification: build clean, post serves 200, both correction phrases ("five figures", "named the family", "gap between ManageEngine") rendered, offending phrase ("better than ManageEngine") is gone.
- Rollback: revert the upcoming PR; prior text is recoverable from git history at `e060fae`.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note rewrite: Mac cybersecurity threats (science-grounded, owner-honest Magic Combo)
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-directed)
- Trigger: Owner pasted detailed annotation on the Mac cybersecurity article (`/field-notes/mac-cybersecurity-threats/`) covering five major changes: (1) iPhone protection section needs honest disclosure that Lockdown Mode is too restrictive for typical pop-star/executive clients to tolerate daily; (2) replace Zimperium as the primary mobile/endpoint recommendation with **ManageEngine Endpoint Central Security Edition** because that is the agent owner actually deploys (operational honesty, not salesmanship); (3) revise the "Magic Combo" section to acknowledge SentinelOne and CrowdStrike are excellent but high-maintenance enterprise tier, with Malwarebytes as light-touch alternative and ManageEngine as the realistic baseline; (4) **most importantly**, foreground **LuLu by Objective-See** as the single highest-impact addition above any Apple-defaults baseline — free, GPLv3, Patrick Wardle (ex-NSA), and the documented reason owner passed a federal red-team engagement; (5) include the AI/local-LLM use case for LuLu (clients running local models who want network-egress visibility).
- Files: `content/field-notes/mac-cybersecurity-threats.md`, `static/field-notes/mac-cybersecurity-threats.bib` (NEW), `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`.
- Pre-write research: ran the explore subagent against eight specific factual claims in parallel — Apple Stolen Device Protection (iOS 17.3, biometric/security-delay model), Apple Lockdown Mode (iOS 16+, exhaustive restriction list), Patrick Wardle NSA tenure (~2008–2010, public bio), LuLu license (GPLv3, github.com/objective-see/LuLu), Little Snitch current status (still actively maintained, version 6.x, Sequoia + Apple Silicon — owner had this wrong but gave himself an out, "or at least I don't think"), the Jeffrey Katzenberg "hack" claim in the original article (unverifiable; replaced with the actually-documented FORCEDENTRY case), ManageEngine Security Edition feature set, and Zimperium FedRAMP/CDM status. All eight came back with primary-source URLs.
- Architect review: ran `architect()` on the full draft + bib. Returned one BLOCKING issue (missing footnotes for `CVE-2021-30858` and `CVE-2021-30632` cited in the WebKit-RCE section) — fixed by adding `[^13]` and `[^14]` and matching BibTeX entries. One false-positive flagged on the BibTeX path (architect recommended `/static/field-notes/...` but Zola serves the `static/` tree at the URL root, so `/field-notes/...bib` is the correct served path; verified by the live 200 response and by every other field-note's bib link).
- Content rewrite (Markdown source 271 lines, 12-entry bibliography → 14 entries after architect fix):
  - **New title**: "Mac Cybersecurity Threats: What Apple Already Protects, What It Doesn't, and the Magic Combo That Closes the Gap" — preserves the indexed slug `mac-cybersecurity-threats`, expands the framing.
  - **TL;DR** (new): names the layered combo explicitly — Apple defaults stay on, ManageEngine for managed agent, LuLu for egress visibility, optional SentinelOne/CrowdStrike for clients who need and can staff enterprise EDR, Malwarebytes as light-touch alternative; Stolen Device Protection on for every iPhone, Lockdown Mode reserved for the actual elevated-threat windows.
  - **Threat model table**: three adversary tiers (commodity criminal, targeted intrusion, state-grade) with the typical defense that breaks each.
  - **Apple's defense-in-depth section**: enumerates XProtect, XProtect Remediator (introduced macOS 12.3), Gatekeeper, Notarization, SIP, App Sandbox, hardened runtime — all cited to the Apple Platform Security Guide.
  - **What gets past the defaults**: replaces the unverifiable Katzenberg-Safari anecdote in the original with the documented FORCEDENTRY case (CVE-2021-30860, CoreGraphics integer overflow processing maliciously crafted PDF via iMessage, attributed to NSO Group's Pegasus, disclosed by Citizen Lab Sept 2021, patched Apple-wide same week). Adds adware/PUP framing tied to Malwarebytes State of Malware data, additional WebKit RCE CVEs, and social-engineering coverage tied to Verizon DBIR.
  - **The Magic Combo (Mac, 2026)**: layered five-tier — (1) Apple defaults stay on, (2) ManageEngine Endpoint Central Security Edition with explicit operational-honesty disclosure ("the agent I have today on my own infrastructure and the one I can stand up for clients quickly"), (3) **LuLu** as the headlined single highest-impact addition above Apple defaults — GPLv3, Patrick Wardle (ex-NSA, ~2008–2010), the federal-red-team anecdote stated as a written-record claim of fact rather than a boast, plus the AI/local-LLM egress-visibility use case, plus an honest acknowledgment that Little Snitch is still maintained as a commercial alternative, (4) optional SentinelOne or CrowdStrike for clients who can fund and staff true enterprise EDR (with the maintenance-overhead caveat stated honestly), (5) Malwarebytes ThreatDown as light-touch alternative.
  - **Email controls section**: cross-link to the existing DNS Security Best Practices field note, brief summary of SPF/DKIM/DMARC/MTA-STS posture.
  - **iPhone protection section** (rewritten):
    - **Stolen Device Protection** (iOS 17.3+) — recommended universally, low friction, high value, blocks the shoulder-surfed-passcode-then-stolen-unlocked-phone attack.
    - **Lockdown Mode** (iOS 16+) — full enumeration of restrictions, then explicit honest disclosure that most active public-facing clients will not tolerate it as a permanent setting; reserve for elevated-threat travel, named persecution targets, journalists in hostile jurisdictions, the period an active threat is known.
    - **Mobile Threat Defense** — ManageEngine mobile module for managed clients; Zimperium for federal-posture clients (FedRAMP Authorized + DHS CDM APL listed).
  - **Conclusion** restates the layered combo + single-line CTA + schedule link.
  - **References (14 footnotes)**: Apple Platform Security Guide (XProtect/Gatekeeper/Notarization), Citizen Lab FORCEDENTRY report (Marczak et al. 2021), MITRE CVE-2021-30860, ManageEngine Endpoint Central Security Edition, LuLu product page + GitHub repo (GPLv3), Malwarebytes State of Malware annual series, Apple Stolen Device Protection support article, Apple Lockdown Mode support article, Verizon DBIR annual series, Little Snitch current product page, Zimperium federal/FedRAMP page + Marketplace listing, MITRE CVE-2021-30858, MITRE CVE-2021-30632.
  - **JSON-LD**: TechArticle schema, datePublished `2025-05-23` (preserved), dateModified `2026-04-19`, full Person + publisher reference, expanded keyword set including new technical terms.
  - **Frontmatter**: added `last_modified: 2026-04-19`, expanded tags to include `iOS`, `EDR`, `LuLu`, `ManageEngine`, `Pegasus`, `threat model`, `XProtect`, `Lockdown Mode`, `Stolen Device Protection`. Updated description to lead with the layered combo framing.
  - **BibTeX**: 14 entries matching the footnotes, served at `/field-notes/mac-cybersecurity-threats.bib` (verified 200), one-click Zotero/reference-manager import.
- Verification: build clean, post serves 200, BibTeX serves 200, JSON-LD present (1 script tag), all four key terms (ManageEngine, LuLu, Stolen Device Protection, FORCEDENTRY) confirmed rendered.
- Why: original article was salesy ("the best and only fully functioning mobile Security product"), cited an unverifiable Katzenberg-Safari hack as the lead anecdote, lacked any primary-source citations, lacked a threat model, and recommended a stack (SentinelOne + CrowdStrike + Zimperium baseline) that does not match what owner actually deploys. The rewrite replaces every weak claim with primary-source-backed fact, names what owner actually deploys (ManageEngine + LuLu), foregrounds LuLu as the single most impactful addition, and gives the iPhone Lockdown Mode discussion the operational-honesty disclosure it always needed. Total scope = 3 files (content + bib NEW + log).
- Rollback: pre-rewrite article at the production URL or via git history at the parent commit of the upcoming PR.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note addition (PR #580 expansion): wireless PoE red-line for modern smart homes
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-corrected; AI executed)
- Trigger: Owner annotated the cabling section of the merged wireless article with a red line through the Cat6 bullet and asked for an explicit hard-line rule: in a modern PoE-rich smart home with PoE cameras, PoE thermostats, PoE access points, and PoE++ gear, Cat6A is the floor — Cat6 is "very weak with PoE." The article previously listed Cat6 as a category with no mention of the PoE-thermal limitation, which leaves the door open for a low-voltage installer to specify Cat6 for a new build that is destined to fail under modern smart-home PoE load.
- Files: `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md`, `static/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.bib`, `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`.
- Architect review: ran `architect()` with the proposed edit drafted, asked for thermal-physics framing verification and standards-citation correctness. Architect returned three concrete tightenings, all applied: (a) revised the red-line phrasing from absolute "never run PoE on Cat6" to scoped engineering policy — "Cat6A or better, every time, for new PoE-dense installs" — because the absolute version is over-strict against the standards reality that Type 1/2 PoE on qualified Cat6 with validated bundle/thermal limits is compliant; (b) clarified PoE++ AP power as "up to 90 W per port at the PSE (~71 W delivered at the PD per IEEE 802.3bt Type 4)" because the 90 W number is the switch-side PSE allocation and the device-side maximum is ~71.3 W per the standard; (c) cleanly separated IEEE 802.3bt's *power-class* envelope from TIA TSB-184-A's *bundle-thermal* territory, because conflating the two would be technically wrong — IEEE defines what wattages are available at PSE/PD; TIA TSB-184-A defines bundle temperature derating and the cable-category recommendations the industry uses for high-power PoE.
- Content added:
  - Cat6 bullet expanded with explicit "Red line for modern PoE-rich smart-home builds — do not cross" callout, the I²R thermal physics, the two-standard split (TIA TSB-184-A for thermal, IEEE 802.3bt for power class), and the conservative engineering call.
  - New "Engineering note: PoE budgets are real load math" paragraph after the cabling list with concrete per-device wattage examples (PoE cameras ~10 W, video doorbell ~5 W, PoE thermostats ~5 W, PoE++ APs up to 90 W PSE / ~71 W PD), arithmetic that puts a typical PoE-rich smart home at well into the hundreds of watts of DC across bundled twisted-pair, and the load-engineering framing.
  - New footnote [^14] citing TIA TSB-184-A (2017).
  - New BibTeX entry `tia_tsb_184a` matching the footnote.
  - Cat6A bullet's PoE++ wattage clarified to "90 W per port at the PSE" for consistency with the new precision.
- Verification: build clean, post serves 200 with PoE callout rendered, BibTeX serves 200, scope = 3 files (content + bib + log) on top of existing PR #580 branch.
- Why: owner's red-line annotation surfaced a real technical gap — the article cited Cat6 alongside higher categories without distinguishing its PoE-thermal limitation, which is the exact failure mode in modern smart homes nobody runs the load math on. The addition makes the engineering distinction explicit, cites the canonical industry document (TIA TSB-184-A), and frames cable category as a load decision rather than a marketing detail.
- Rollback: pre-addition state at commit `3809f62` on `field-notes/wireless-network-corrections-2026`.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note correction (PR #579 follow-up): wireless 10 Gbps case + 15-vs-27-year reconciliation
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-corrected; AI executed)
- Trigger: Owner read PR #579 and flagged two precision items: (1) the "10 Gbps symmetric to a laptop" bullet had the wrong cause — the bottleneck was not the laptop's NIC, it was the switch in the closet topping out at 1 GbE; the MacBook Pro's USB-C was perfectly capable, and the fix was a fully backwards-compatible multi-gig switch (real copper at every rate on every port) plus a 10 GbE USB-C adapter; (2) the article's "fifteen years" framing needed honest reconciliation with the site-wide "27+ years" headline number — owner has been in IT for 27+ years total, with the multi-gig speed-to-endpoint tracking discipline specifically being about fifteen years old (going back to the 1 Gbps cable-modem heyday and the 2.5 GbE switch-floor decision the moment 2 Gbps service arrived).
- Files: `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md`, `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`.
- Architect review: ran `architect()` with both proposed edits drafted, asked for framing input on the 15-vs-27 reconciliation per owner's explicit request. Architect returned three concrete refinements, all applied: (a) rephrased "negotiated everything down to 1 GbE" to "every wired link in that path was capped at 1 GbE by the switch" — more technically precise about how Ethernet auto-negotiation actually works (each link negotiates to highest common rate, not "everything globally down-negotiated"); (b) scoped the multi-gig switch rate-set claim to "the model I installed" rather than implying universal "multi-gig" property — protects against the real-world fact that some lower-tier "multi-gig" switches drop rates on subsets of ports; (c) used exact "27+ years" in the body section rather than approximate "over twenty-five" to match the site-wide authoritative number, since this article is specifically resolving a numeric inconsistency. Also softened "first became measurable" to "first became impossible to ignore in my field work" — owner's personal-practice framing rather than a contestable historical claim.
- TL;DR also updated to carry the one-line reconciliation: "Tracking the gap between speed paid for and speed actually delivered to the endpoint has been my discipline for fifteen years (out of 27+ in IT overall)" — top-of-article scan-level consistency with the body.
- Section heading kept as "My Fifteen-Year Standard: Speed You Pay For, Delivered to Your Endpoint" — the heading names the specific multi-gig discipline length, the body now names total career; both are honest and consistent.
- Verification: build clean, post serves 200, scope = 2 files (content + log) on top of the existing branch.
- Why: owner-flagged factual precision and his explicit request for honest disclosure that the "fifteen years" in this specific article refers to the multi-gig tracking discipline, not total IT career. Site says "27 years" / "27+ years" on about, billing, and homepage; the wireless article now reconciles the two without making the prose tortured.
- Rollback: pre-correction state at commit `302b33f` on `field-notes/wireless-network-2026`.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note enhancement: why-your-wireless-network-sucks
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-directed; AI executed)
- Scope: `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md` targeted enhancement, fifth in the "make it scientific" rewrite series after engrams (PR #575), ijail (PR #576), scientific-method (PR #577), and DNS security (PR #578).
- Trigger: Owner directive with explicit context note. Three things asked for: (1) **enforce, do not soften, the "copy of a copy" framing**, with scientific grounding underneath it; (2) work in his fifteen-year track record of getting clients the speed they pay for to the endpoint, with concrete proofs (iPhone next to a 5G mid-band cell site hitting multi-gigabit on the carrier network; 10 Gbps symmetric to a client laptop via a Thunderbolt/USB 10 GbE adapter); (3) honestly scope where wireless mesh actually works (modern Wi-Fi 6/7 with wired backhaul does soften the old "always halve" rule when properly deployed) versus where it does not (consumer extenders), and acknowledge specialized environments (mine rescue, military) use engineered systems — leaky-feeder cable, P25 land-mobile radio, MANET — that are not consumer 802.11 gear.
- Slug: kept as `why-your-wireless-network-sucks` to preserve inbound-link equity. Owner explicitly approved a title change "if best practice"; slug change would have required 301 redirect machinery that wasn't worth the link-equity cost. Title updated to `Why Your Wireless Network Sucks: Copy of a Copy, and the Ethernet Backbone That Fixes It` to put the owner's signature framing front and center.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.md` — targeted enhancement. Frontmatter: `last_modified: 2026-04-19`, expanded `description`/tags (added `wi-fi 6`, `wi-fi 7`, `mesh`, `csma-ca`, `shannon`, `ubiquiti`, `poe`), updated all `og_*`/`twitter_*` titles and descriptions to match new title. New TechArticle JSON-LD block (article previously had no schema) with `dateModified` 2026-04-19. New TL;DR up top establishing the half-duplex CSMA/CA foundation, the 1/2^n hop-degradation math, the wired-backhaul fix, the modern Wi-Fi 6/7-with-backhaul concession, the specialized-environments scoping, and the fifteen-year personal track record. Expanded "Copy of a Copy" section with four-bullet physics breakdown: half-duplex airtime sharing, multiplicative compounding across hops, Shannon-Hartley capacity loss with distance and noise (C = B · log₂(1 + S/N), with the −3 dB → ~0.5 linear S/N correctness check), and retransmit compounding. Replaced the original generic "IEEE Xplore Document 8718141" link with footnoted citations to IEEE Std 802.11-2020, Bianchi 2000 (JSAC, DOI 10.1109/49.840210), Shannon 1948 (BSTJ, DOI 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x), and the Akyildiz/Wang/Wang 2005 *Computer Networks* mesh-networks survey (DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2004.12.001). New "When Wireless Mesh Actually Works — and What That Costs" section explicitly naming the two cases where the old halving rule softens (Wi-Fi 6/7 with wired backhaul; specialized non-802.11 systems for mining/military) — heads off the common "but mesh works in caves" objection by naming what is actually deployed there (leaky-feeder coax per NIOSH, P25 per TIA-102, MANETs on dedicated hardware). New "My Fifteen-Year Standard" section incorporating owner's track record statement and three field cases (the 5G-tower-next-door speed test, the 10 Gbps symmetric to a client laptop via 10 GbE Thunderbolt/USB adapter, the 2.5/5 GbE switch gap as silent cap on multi-gig service citing IEEE 802.3bz-2016). Cabling-standards section now cites ANSI/TIA-568.2-D (2018) and IEEE 802.3-2022/802.3bq-2016/802.3bt-2018 as the primary sources for category ratings, distance limits (Cat6A 10 Gb at 100 m; Cat8 25/40 Gb at ~30 m), and PoE++ class limits. Replaced the original article's "shoddy exclusive distributor deal that only offers specific networking equipment, and they won't be able to mark up the excellent quality gear by 20-40%" line with the more neutral "we choose gear on merit rather than on which exclusive distributor a shop happens to be locked into" — owner's context note explicitly said he wants to elevate his own competence rather than denigrate other IT guys. Single-line CTA pattern preserved with `schedule.it-help.tech` link. Added References section at the end with all 13 footnote definitions and link to BibTeX companion.
  - `static/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.bib` — new file. BibTeX entries for all 13 references: IEEE Std 802.11-2020, Bianchi 2000, Shannon 1948, Akyildiz/Wang/Wang 2005 mesh survey, IEEE Std 802.11ax-2021 (Wi-Fi 6), IEEE Std 802.11be-2024 (Wi-Fi 7), IEEE Std 802.3bt-2018 (PoE++), NIOSH mine-communications page, TIA P25 program page, IEEE Std 802.3bz-2016 (NBASE-T), ANSI/TIA-568.2-D, IEEE Std 802.3-2022, IEEE Std 802.3bq-2016 (25/40GBASE-T).

  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Architect review: ran `architect()` on the draft. Three publish-blocking precision items caught and fixed before push: (1) **MUST-FIX citation mismatch** — body text referred to the Akyildiz et al. 2005 survey as an *IEEE Communications Magazine* paper, but the bib entry and DOI correctly identified it as *Computer Networks* 47(4):445–487. Body corrected to *Computer Networks*. (2) **MUST-FIX standards currency** — original [^6] cited only the IEEE 802.11be working group page, which read evasive in 2026. Updated to cite IEEE Std 802.11be-2024 directly with the WG page retained as a status-tracking link, and bib entry updated to match. (3) **MUST-FIX overclaim** — original "iPhone... next to a visible 5G mid-band cell site... north of 6 Gbps" is not broadly defensible without device/band/timestamped test artifacts; softened to "into multi-gigabit territory on the carrier network — well above what the same phone manages indoors a hundred feet later," which preserves the proof point (carrier supply side delivers; chain inside the house is the bottleneck) without an indefensible specific peak number. Architect explicitly approved the rest of the technical framing: half-duplex CSMA/CA + single-radio/single-channel airtime contention, ~halving per unwired hop as a teaching abstraction, Bianchi 2000 metadata and usage, Shannon-Hartley formula and −3 dB ≈ 0.5 linear S/N, Cat5e/Cat6/Cat6A/Cat8 + 802.3bt/bz/bq claims.
- Verification: `zola serve` build clean. Post and BibTeX both serve 200 at `/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks/` and `/field-notes/why-your-wireless-network-sucks.bib`. All preserved internal links and images intact. `dateModified` JSON-LD field matches `last_modified` frontmatter.
- Why: Fifth in the owner-directed series. Different from the prior four because owner sent an unusually detailed context note explicitly asking for the "copy of a copy" framing to be ENFORCED with scientific physics underneath it, his fifteen-year track record made explicit, and honest scoping of the modern Wi-Fi 6/7 + wired backhaul concession plus the specialized-environments edge case. The half-duplex CSMA/CA + Shannon-Hartley + retransmit-compounding tetrad gives his metaphor real physics, which is exactly the upgrade he asked for.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note enhancement: dns-security-best-practices
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-directed; AI executed)
- Scope: `content/field-notes/dns-security-best-practices.md` targeted enhancement, fourth in the "make it scientific" rewrite series after engrams (PR #575), ijail (PR #576), and scientific-method (PR #577).
- Trigger: Owner directive — but unlike the prior three this article was already in much better shape: operationally distinctive (the SPF `-all` vs `~all` analysis with the RFC 7489 §10.1 short-circuit explanation is correct and well-argued), already structured with TechArticle/FAQPage/HowTo JSON-LD, already had the on-brand single-line CTA that the others were modeled on. Strategy was therefore **targeted enhancement, not rewrite**: preserve every operationally-correct sentence verbatim, add a TL;DR for series consistency, add a new "Threat Model" section that scopes honestly which attacks the controls address vs. which they do not, footnote-cite primary IETF RFCs and federal/industry guidance throughout, replace the "Statistical Urgency" section with properly-cited threat context inside the new Threat Model section, expand the DNSSEC paragraph to honestly scope what it does and doesn't do, add a BibTeX companion file.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/dns-security-best-practices.md` — targeted enhancement. `last_modified` updated to 2026-04-19; `dateModified` in TechArticle JSON-LD updated to match. Tags expanded to include `MTA-STS`, `TLS-RPT`, `DANE`, `BIMI`, `IC3`, `threat model`. New TL;DR up top distilling the SPF `~all` + DKIM + DMARC `p=reject` baseline. New "Threat Model: What These Controls Actually Defend Against" section explicitly mapping each vector to the controls that address it (direct-domain spoofing → SPF/DKIM/DMARC; lookalike-domain → CT logs / brand monitoring / training, NOT email auth; mail-in-transit → MTA-STS / TLS-RPT / DANE; DNS-response forgery → DNSSEC; account takeover → MFA / conditional access, NOT DMARC). FBI IC3 2023 figures (880,418 complaints, $12.5B losses) and Verizon 2024 DBIR cited inside this section. Footnoted citations [^1]-[^15] added throughout for every protocol and guidance reference. Expanded DNSSEC section with honest scoping notes (authenticates DNS responses not email content; doesn't encrypt mail in transit; adoption uneven; foundation for DANE; Kaminsky 2008 cache-poisoning attack named as motivating threat). Removed the standalone "Standards Reference (RFC 7489 §10.1)" section because that source is now footnoted [^1] inline at the relevant claim. Removed "Statistical Urgency" section because its content rolled into Threat Model with proper citation. Replaced bare BIMI link with citation to AuthIndicators Working Group spec. Added References section at the end with all 15 footnote definitions. Preserved verbatim: full SPF -all vs ~all analysis, the 7-step setup guide, all three JSON-LD blocks (TechArticle/FAQPage/HowTo), CISA Cyber Hygiene stakeholder mention, all images and internal links (`/services/`, `dnstool.it-help.tech`, `redsift.com`, `securitytrails.com`), and the on-brand single-line CTA "Call 619-853-5008."

  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Architect review: ran `architect()` on the draft. Three publish-blocking precision items caught and fixed before push: (1) **MUST-FIX RFC 8301 overclaim** — original draft said "RFC 8301 deprecated SHA-1 with RSA for DKIM and recommends RSA keys of at least 2048 bits; 1024-bit keys are no longer considered adequate"; rewritten to separate the normative deprecation (SHA-1) from the operational baseline (the SHOULD-clause for 2048-bit keys and the operational reality that 1024-bit provides a much smaller margin against modern factoring resources). (2) **MUST-FIX bulk-sender threshold scoping** — original said "Google and Yahoo's bulk-sender requirements have made SPF + DKIM + DMARC effectively mandatory for any sender exceeding ~5,000 messages per day to their users"; rewritten to explicitly tie the ~5,000/day threshold to personal Gmail accounts and note Yahoo's parallel-but-not-identical framing rather than conflating the two providers' policies. (3) **MUST-FIX DMARCbis currency phrasing** — original "Operators should track the working group's outputs for forward-compatible deployments" could look stale if DMARCbis has already been published as a successor RFC by April 2026; rewritten to acknowledge the publication-status uncertainty explicitly ("Whether the revision has been published as a successor RFC at the time you are reading this or remains in late-stage draft, the working group page is the canonical place to check current status"), which is honest rather than evasive. Also dropped a NIST SP 800-177 Rev. 1 §4.5 pinpoint reference I was not confident about; cite document only.

- Why: Fourth in the owner-directed series. Same engineering bar as PRs #575/#576/#577 — anchor every substantive claim in primary sources with DOIs or canonical URLs, ship a BibTeX companion for the academic readership the owner has named as the audience that recognized this method in his work. Different from the prior three in that this article's existing structure and on-brand CTA were the model the others copied, so the goal was to add citation depth and honest threat-model scoping without disturbing what was already working.

### 2026-04-19 — Field-note rewrite: it-problem-solving-scientific-method
- Actor: AI+Developer (owner-directed; AI executed)
- Scope: `content/field-notes/it-problem-solving-scientific-method.md` modernization, third in the "make it scientific" rewrite series after engrams (PR #575) and ijail (PR #576).
- Trigger: Owner directive — original (May 2025) read as a personal practitioner narrative with no citations, no cognitive-bias framing, and no honest scoping of where the seven-step method works vs. doesn't. Owner wanted (1) the seven-step spine preserved (it's load-bearing across the site and owner has internalized it), (2) primary-source grounding with DOIs, (3) the cognitive-science layer that explains *why* the discipline beats unstructured guessing, (4) honest acknowledgment of where the method adapts (complex vs. complicated problems), (5) the existing ethical-transparency thread elevated and named as informed consent, (6) BibTeX companion file for one-click Zotero import, and (7) the marketing-style closer replaced with a single-line on-brand contact cue.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/it-problem-solving-scientific-method.md` — full rewrite. Slug preserved (already indexed; self-referenced from elsewhere). New `updated: 2026-04-19` field; categories extended; tags now include `diagnostic reasoning`, `cognitive bias`, `falsifiability`, `Cynefin`, `postmortem`. New sections: TL;DR, "Why the Scientific Method, Specifically" (Popper falsifiability / Peirce abduction / Hempel HD method), "The Diagnostic Failure Modes the Method Defeats" (Croskerry-grounded list of biases — anchoring, confirmation, premature closure, availability, search satisficing — with one-sentence IT examples each, plus Norman et al. 2017 counterpoint that knowledge gaps matter at least as much as biases), "When the Method Adapts: Complicated vs. Complex Problems" (Cynefin five-domain acknowledgment, complicated/complex contrast, Allspaw/SNAFUcatchers iterative-probing model), "The Ethical Dimension" (informed consent + Kahneman & Klein 2009 on conditions for trustworthy expert intuition). Each of the seven steps now names the discipline it borrows from and the bias it is built to defeat. Single-line CTA at the bottom matches the `dns-security-best-practices.md` pattern.

- Architect review: ran `architect()` on the draft. Three must-fix items caught and fixed before push: (1) **MUST-FIX philosophy overclaim** — "Every working scientist applies all three" (Popper/Peirce/Hempel) is too strong for a PhD-heavy audience; rewritten to "None of these is a universal account of how science actually proceeds, but together they describe a pattern of reasoning that working scientists draw on constantly." (2) **MUST-FIX internal contradiction** — TL;DR originally said "Most IT troubleshooting failures are not knowledge failures," which contradicts the later (correctly framed) summary of Norman et al. 2017; TL;DR rewritten to acknowledge both knowledge gaps and diagnostic-reasoning failures as intertwined causes. (3) **MUST-FIX SRE framing** — Conclusion section originally invoked "root cause" in a way that implied monocausal certainty; rewritten to use "contributing conditions" and explicitly note that modern SRE convention treats incidents as the product of multiple contributing conditions in a socio-technical system rather than a single discoverable root cause. (4) Optional polish accepted — added explicit acknowledgment that Cynefin distinguishes five domains (clear / complicated / complex / chaotic / disorder) before narrowing to the complicated/complex contrast that matters for working IT troubleshooting.

### 2026-04-19 (Content · `apple-sends-you-to-ijail` field note rewritten as Apple+Google "Don't Guess Wrong" — cognitive-science framing, BibTeX companion, salesy CTA stripped)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent + architect subagent)
- Severity: LOW (single content rewrite + one new static asset; no template, schema, or routing changes; slug preserved, so all backlinks and the ItemList JSON-LD on `content/field-notes/_index.md` continue to resolve)
- Trigger: Owner directive — original post (June 2025) read as marketing copy for an Apple-only support service. Owner wanted (1) the article transformed into a science-grounded field note, (2) the scope expanded to cover Google as well as Apple because the in-session intervention he most often performs is on clients about to lock themselves out of Gmail, (3) the owner's actual teaching thesis brought to the surface: when you sit down to type a password you either *know* it or you don't; consulting paper means you don't; two attempts maximum, then start the recovery flow on purpose.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/apple-sends-you-to-ijail.md` — full rewrite. Slug preserved (already indexed; "iJail" framing is retained in the body). New title: "Don't Guess Wrong: Apple, Google, and the Memory Science Behind Account Lockouts." New `updated: 2026-04-19` field; categories now include Google; tags include `metacognition` and `tip of the tongue`. New sections: "The Moment I Catch in Almost Every Session" (narrative opener — the Gmail typing scenario, the pause-or-not moment), "Why 'I Almost Know It' Is a Lie Your Brain Tells You" (cognitive-science section), "The Paper Test" (transcription vs. retrieval), "What Apple Actually Does When You Guess Wrong" (factual lockout behavior; iPhone passcode escalation table 6→1m / 7→5m / 8→15m / 9→60m / 10→disabled-and-erase), "What Google Actually Does When You Guess Wrong" (risk-based authentication, g.co/recover, Workspace caveat), "The Cost Asymmetry No One Likes to Discuss" (single restrained editorial paragraph replacing the original's "Punish criminals, not customers" line), "The Don't-Guess-Wrong Protocol" (5-step checklist, two attempts max), and a Prevention section split into Apple and Google 7-tip lists. Heavy multi-paragraph "Looking for Mac IT Support in San Diego, CA?" CTA replaced with a single on-brand contact line matching the pattern used in `dns-security-best-practices.md`.

Placed as a blockquote epigraph above the TL;DR — the first line the reader sees. Owner's own words; no architect review required for owner-originated copy.
- Architect review: ran `architect()` on the draft. Five issues caught and fixed before push: (1) **MUST-FIX factual error** — iPhone passcode escalation said "5 wrong → 1 minute" but Apple's documented sequence starts at 6 wrong; corrected. (2) **MUST-FIX overclaim** — TOT phrasing "routinely produce wrong answers with high confidence" was too strong for the underlying literature; rewritten to bound the claim ("the signal is informative on average but not reliable at the level of any single attempt"). (3) **SHOULD-TIGHTEN** — proactive-interference application to passwords was extrapolative from general memory literature; added an explicit one-sentence caveat marking it as applied interpretation. (4) Google "may take several business days to adjudicate" softened to mirror Google's own less-legalistic phrasing. (5) Paper Test absolutist "it has never been wrong" softened to "I have yet to see it fail." (6) Footer CTA trimmed from two sentences to one to match the on-brand minimal-cue pattern.

### 2026-04-19 (Content · `hack-your-engrams` field note modernized: current science, NIST 800-63B-4, BibTeX companion)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent + architect subagent)
- Severity: LOW (single content rewrite + one new static asset; no template, schema, or routing changes)
- Trigger: Owner directive to bring the post current with modern password science, current NIST guidance, and proper academic citations. The original post (June 2025) cited NIST SP 800-63B-3 (§5.1.1.2), referenced only two sources, and used PMC URLs rather than DOIs. Reader audience includes sophisticated technical clients capable of checking sources.
- Files:
  - `content/field-notes/hack-your-engrams-to-remember-passwords.md` — full rewrite. New title (subtitle changed from "and Keep Passwords Private" to "Memorable Passphrases That Stay Private"). New `updated: 2026-04-19` frontmatter field. New sections: "The Threat Model Most Articles Skip" (frames the trusted-observer adversary explicitly), "What NIST Actually Says in 2026" (summarizes SP 800-63B-4: no composition rules, no rotation, no hints/KBA, 8-char min / 64 recommended, all printing + Unicode, breach-corpus screening, passkeys preferred), "Where This Technique Fits in 2026" (passkeys first, password manager for the rest, memorable passphrases reserved for the small set you have to type by hand). Quick-Risk-Check table expanded to call out keyloggers, phishing/network capture, and camera/screen-recording threats as out-of-scope. Forced-disclosure callout preserved and expanded with hardware-key + duress-credential pointer.
  - `static/field-notes/hack-your-engrams.bib` — new file. BibTeX entries for all eight references (Baumeister 2001, McGaugh 2004, LaBar & Cabeza 2006, Hunt 1995, Josselyn & Tonegawa 2020, Slamecka & Graf 1978, NIST 800-63B-4, W3C WebAuthn L3). Linked from the bottom of the post for one-click Zotero import.
  - Citations switched from PMC URLs to DOIs throughout (more permanent, machine-citable). Inline footnote syntax (`[^1]`) used so they hyperlink and back-reference automatically.
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry.
- Change: Post is now scientifically current and properly cited. Three mechanisms now grounded in primary sources: negativity bias (Baumeister), emotional consolidation (McGaugh; LaBar & Cabeza), distinctiveness (Hunt — corrected to von Restorff's actual finding about distinctive *processing*, not merely distinctive items). The "engram" metaphor is now grounded in Josselyn & Tonegawa's 2020 *Science* review of optogenetic engram research. Generation effect (Slamecka & Graf) added as a fourth implicit mechanism. NIST guidance updated to SP 800-63B-4. Passkeys (W3C WebAuthn L3) introduced as the preferred path with passphrases positioned as the fallback for the small set of secrets that must be typed by hand. Strategic claim — that the technique is a *behavioral interlock* against the trusted-observer threat — moved into the lede where it belongs.
- Why: Owner brand voice is calm, specific, and discreet. The original was correct directionally but read as a clever-trick post; the rewrite frames it as an applied-neuroscience note for a sophisticated readership. The threat-model framing (without naming clientele) makes it usable as a teaching artifact for the kind of high-profile clients who benefit most from it.
- Architect review: ran `architect()` on the draft. Three MUST-FIX items caught and fixed before push: (1) the passphrase-construction "rules" were rewritten as *heuristics* so they do not contradict the NIST "no composition rules" point made one section earlier; (2) absolute phrasing ("nobody else can guess it") replaced with risk-based language ("the underlying imagery is not in any public record about you"); (3) camera/screen-recording explicitly added to the out-of-scope list.
- Verification: `zola serve` builds clean (12 pages, 0 link errors). Post renders at `/field-notes/hack-your-engrams-to-remember-passwords/`. BibTeX file serves 200 at `/field-notes/hack-your-engrams.bib` and parses correctly.
- Rollback: revert this PR. Single content file rewrite + single new static asset; no template, schema, sitemap, or routing impact.

### 2026-04-19 (IA · `/blog/*` section renamed to `/field-notes/*` site-wide)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent)
- Severity: MEDIUM (URL change; SEO/redirect coordination required outside the repo)
- Trigger: Owner directive to bring the URL path in line with the long-standing in-app label "Field Notes". The nav link, footer link, and page semantics already used the "Field Notes" name; only the URL slug `/blog/` was inconsistent.
- Files:
  - `content/blog/` → renamed to `content/field-notes/` (7 markdown files, all `git mv`'d so history is preserved). Per-post `extra.canonical_url` and JSON-LD `mainEntityOfPage` URLs updated to `/field-notes/...`. Cross-link inside `mac-cybersecurity-threats.md` updated. Phrase "blog post like this" inside `it-problem-solving-scientific-method.md` softened to "field note like this".
  - `content/field-notes/_index.md` — title, description, seo_title, OG/Twitter copy, ItemList JSON-LD URLs, and `template = "field-notes.html"` updated.
  - `templates/blog.html` → renamed to `templates/field-notes.html` (`git mv`). Inline H1 "Blog Posts" → "Field Notes". Default OG/Twitter title/description fallbacks updated.
  - `templates/page.html` — comment updated.
  - `templates/base.html` — primary nav link `/blog/` → `/field-notes/` (label "Field Notes" already correct). aria-current branches and rev-comment updated.
  - `templates/partials/_footer-org.html` — Expertise column "Field Notes" link `/blog` → `/field-notes`.
  - `templates/sitemap.xml` — pagination skip rule updated to `/field-notes/page/1/`.
  - `config.toml` — main menu entry renamed `Blog` → `Field Notes`, URL `/blog/` → `/field-notes/`.
  - `static/robots.txt` — `Allow: /blog/` → `Allow: /field-notes/`.
  - `static/llms.txt` — Optional section entry updated.
  - `static/llms-full.txt` — Optional section heading + URLs updated (legacy Phase A snapshot file).
  - `infra/llms/llms-full.config.json` — Optional entry label + file path updated.
  - `infra/llms/build-llms-full.mjs` — example comment updated.
  - `content/dns-tool.md` — "DNS Security Best Practices" outbound link rewritten to `/field-notes/...`.
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css` — comment updated.
  - `scripts/check-no-external-subresources.sh` — comment updated.
  - `AGENTS.md` — Architecture layout, content/schema table, and SEO architecture paragraph updated to reference `field-notes` and `field-notes.html`.
- Change: All references to the `/blog/` URL path replaced with `/field-notes/` site-wide. The Zola section directory rename causes Zola to emit the new permalinks automatically; templates, sitemap, robots, llms-full, and JSON-LD ItemList all now point at the new URLs. Nav and footer labels were already "Field Notes" — only URLs (and the H1 on the index) shift. Legacy `static/llms-full.txt` (still committed pending Phase C deletion) was updated in-place to keep the snapshot consistent.
- Why: URL/label parity. Owner brand voice positions these articles as practitioner write-ups, not "blog posts" — the `/field-notes/` URL slug now matches the long-standing nav label and the in-content terminology.
- Verification: `zola serve` builds clean (12 pages, 1 section, 0 internal-link errors). `curl /field-notes/` and `/field-notes/dns-security-best-practices/` return 200. `/sitemap.xml` lists all six new permalinks. `/robots.txt` advertises the new path. `grep -rn "/blog" --exclude-dir=themes` returns only historical PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG entries (intentionally preserved as history).
- Outside-repo follow-up (CloudFront, owner): add 301 redirects from `/blog/*` → `/field-notes/*` (preserve path tail). Without this, externally cached links to the old slug will 404. This repo has no `_redirects` file; the redirect must live in CloudFront (CloudFront Function or behavior-level rule on distribution `E2TEEM88QINCGT`). Once the redirect is live, any backlinks/Google index entries pointing at the old URLs will transition seamlessly.
- Rollback: revert this PR on the corporate repo. The Zola section dir rename reverses cleanly via `git revert` since all moves were `git mv`.

### 2026-04-18 (Docs · `replit.md` reduced to platform-owned stub; AGENTS.md becomes sole governance source)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent + architect subagent)
- Severity: MEDIUM (changes the documented source-of-truth hierarchy for all AI agents on this repo)
- Trigger: Replit's checkpoint subsystem was repeatedly stripping `replit.md` on every "Loop ended" event. Three strips observed in a single session (137 → 46 → 78 → 45 lines), each commit titled "Restore..." but actually deleting 90+ lines. Author trailer `careybalboa <43527839-careybalboa@users.noreply.replit.com>` and commit headers `Replit-Commit-Checkpoint-Type: full_checkpoint` + `Replit-Helium-Checkpoint-Created: true` confirmed platform automation as the source. No documented `.replit` flag disables the behavior. Owner directive: "find out how to prevent this error."
- Files:
  - `replit.md` — reduced from 137 lines to ~12-line stub: title, one paragraph explaining the stub policy, canonical-sources block pointing to `AGENTS.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
  - `AGENTS.md` — folded in Development Workflow, Deploy & Build Pipeline, Project Architecture (At-a-Glance), and "Why replit.md Is a Stub" sections. Mandatory Read list updated to drop `replit.md` and elevate `AGENTS.md` itself as primary
  - `.github/workflows/replit-md-guard.yml` — new CI guard fails any PR where `replit.md` exceeds 30 lines or drops the canonical-sources pointers (`AGENTS.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`)
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry
- Change: AGENTS.md is now the sole canonical source for engineering governance, dev workflow, deploy pipeline, and project architecture pointers. `replit.md` is intentionally disposable; the platform may rewrite it freely without affecting governance. CI guard at PR boundary blocks any future re-expansion (whether from the platform auto-summarizer or from accidental human edits).
- Why: Architect-validated root cause — the Replit checkpoint subsystem treats `replit.md` as an auto-summary file it owns, derived from a project metadata pass that fires after the agent loop ends. Fighting it inside the loop is futile (autocommit lands after the agent's last action). Architect ranked five mitigation options; the durable fix is option (a): deny the auto-summarizer anything meaningful to summarize, and let CI catch any drift at PR time. Options (b) `.gitignore`, (c) author/line-delta pre-commit hook, and (d) `.replit` config flag were rejected (no supported flag; hooks may not run for platform commits; ignoring breaks fresh-clone bootstrap). The 137-line `replit.md` we kept restoring was itself a prior platform summary, not the owner's original — confirming the file has not been durably owner-controlled for some time.
- Rollback: revert this PR. Note: reverting reintroduces the strip-cycle on every checkpoint and re-orphans governance content into a file the platform overwrites unpredictably.

### 2026-04-18 (Audit gate · jitter elimination via median-of-3 with leading-indicator warnings)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent + architect subagent)
- Severity: MEDIUM (CI infrastructure; affects every deploy going forward; engineering bar preserved exactly)
- Trigger: Owner reported recurring CI false-failures from single-sample Lighthouse jitter on the homepage mobile audit. PR #554 deploy hit P=96, PR #557 deploy hit P=95 — both cleared on manual GitHub-UI re-run. Owner directive: "fix it, get some deep research with the architect and find a path forward so we're very clean and healthy."
- Files:
  - `infra/audit/run-lighthouse.mjs` — rewritten: collects N samples per (url, formFactor), computes per-category-independent median, fails on median < threshold, emits non-failing warning when any single sample dipped below threshold but median passed
  - `infra/audit/audit.config.json` — added `lighthouse.samplesPerAudit` (default 3); existing thresholds unchanged
  - `infra/audit/README.md` — new "Why median-of-N" section + cost analysis + samplesPerAudit documentation
  - `replit.md` — Engineering Bar section updated to describe median-of-N gate; Recent Changes entry added
- Change: Single-sample → median-of-3 gate. For each (url, formFactor) pair, run Lighthouse 3 times, take median per category independently, fail the deploy only if any per-category median drops below its threshold. A separate warning (non-failing) lists any single-sample sub-threshold dips where median still passed — that surfaces thinning-margin pages as a leading indicator without blocking the deploy. `samplesPerAudit` is configurable in `audit.config.json` and falls back to 3.
- Why: Architect deep-research evaluated 7 options (best-of-N, median-of-N, conditional retry, soft tolerance, Lighthouse-CI migration, throttling-method swap, hybrid retry+median) and recommended median-of-N (option 2) for this project's constraints: privacy-first static site, perfectionist owner, deploy time matters but not critical, no observability stack. Best-of-N rejected because it would actively mask intermittent real regressions. Lighthouse-CI migration rejected as fighting the existing JSON config schema. Median-of-3 keeps the engineering bar honest — a real regression that triggers in ≥2 of 3 samples still fails the gate — while a single jittery sample no longer false-fails. Median is computed per-category-independently (not over the full report) so a Performance dip can't be averaged away by perfect Accessibility/SEO. Cost: Lighthouse phase grows from ~96s to ~5min per deploy (24 audits × ~12s); Observatory unchanged.
- Rollback: revert this PR; or set `lighthouse.samplesPerAudit: 1` in `audit.config.json` to revert to the original single-sample behavior without code changes.

### 2026-04-17 (Topbar · Architect-validated definitive seam fix — capability-stratified surface treatment + decorative top-fade)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent + architect subagent)
- Severity: MEDIUM (touches every viewport; root-cause fix for a recurring complaint)
- Trigger: Owner reported the mobile topbar seam was still visible after `border-bottom: 0; box-shadow: none;` (PR #547). Marked the seam in red on a fresh iPhone screenshot. Directive: "I want it to be beautiful, perfect, and scientific for mobile, iPads, and everything else." Architect was consulted via the code_review skill with full diagnostic context.
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css` — topbar shell rewritten as 3-tier stratified rule (base / desktop fine-pointer / touch override); circuit-bg + logo-constellation gained 56px top-fade `mask-image`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md` — codified the stratification rule and the never-tint-with-non-c1 invariant
- Change: Root-caused the seam as a SURFACE DISCONTINUITY (not a border): the previous `@supports (color-mix)` block tinted the topbar from `--surface-charcoal` while body bg uses `--c1` — two different colors meeting at a hard horizontal line, no border could erase it. Plus `backdrop-filter` on a sticky element creates a device-dependent compositor edge on iOS/iPadOS. New stratification: BASE rule `.topbar { background: var(--c1); border-bottom: 0; box-shadow: none; backdrop-filter: none; }` so the topbar matches body exactly; DESKTOP rule `@media (min-width: 961px) and (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` re-enables glass + gold hairline but mixes from `--c1` (continuous with page); TOUCH override `@media (hover: none), (pointer: coarse)` forces solid treatment for iPad landscape >960px and any touch laptop. Decorative layers gain `mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0, rgba(0,0,0,1) 56px)` so circuit grid + constellation dots fade in smoothly below the topbar.
- Why: Previous attempts (border-color transparent → border 0 → box-shadow none) treated symptoms. The architect's deeper analysis identified that the surface color mismatch IS the seam — eliminating the color step is the only definitive fix. The capability query pattern (hover/pointer instead of just min-width) correctly handles iPad landscape, which exceeds 960px but is a touch device and shouldn't get the glass treatment.
- Rollback: revert this PR.

### 2026-04-17 (Hero · Tagline rewrite to "IT research in motion." + mobile topbar seam fix)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent)
- Severity: LOW (copy + decorative-border fix; zero structural change)
- Trigger: Owner direction — "I really like the IT research in motion. I think that's a good slogan. The text right below it already says that, so it's not like we need to say it twice. Plus, I think it's a better slogan." Also reported a "tiny line" near the top of the screen visible when toggling the mobile hamburger.
- Files:
  - `templates/partials/hero_logo.html` — tagline copy revised to a single line: `IT research <span class="highlight">in motion</span>.`
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css` — within `@media (max-width: 960px)`, added `.topbar { border-bottom-color: transparent; }` so the topbar's gold hairline is dropped on mobile/compact widths only. Desktop retains the WCAG-1.4.11-compliant 38% gold border from PR #545.
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md` — hero tagline rule updated; new highlight word is `in motion`; explicit guidance that the H1 below the pill carries the literal proposition for SEO and the pill carries the brand promise (no duplication).
- Change: Hero tagline rewritten from `We solve tech problems. / No monthly retainers.` (two lines, two highlights) to `IT research in motion.` (single line, one highlight). The H1 retained verbatim. Mobile topbar bottom border (38% gold hairline) hidden inside `@media (max-width: 960px)`; desktop unchanged.
- Why: The previous tagline duplicated the H1 directly below it, creating cognitive triple-redundancy (page title, hero pill, H1). "IT research in motion" is a stronger brand promise that complements rather than echoes the proposition. The mobile gold hairline was added in PR #545 for desktop UI-component contrast (WCAG 1.4.11) but on mobile the line read as a stray seam, especially during drawer open/close transitions. WCAG 1.4.11 doesn't apply to purely decorative borders, so removing it on mobile is fully compliant.
- Rollback: revert this PR.

### 2026-04-17 (Brand · Owl favicon set + brand-banner OG image + mobile drawer seam fix)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent)
- Severity: MEDIUM (visible brand change on every browser tab + every social share; CSS-only mobile fix)
- Trigger: Owner attached the Athenian-owl medallion (`NORM-proof-transparent-1080`) and the IT+HELP brand banner (`IT-Help-Brand-Banner`) and asked to "use my owl and my banner". Also reported a faint hairline seam under the topbar when the mobile drawer is open — "It just doesn't separate well and you see that tiny little line."
- Files:
  - `static/img/brand/owl.png` (new, 1080×1080 transparent) — canonical owl mark
  - `static/img/brand/it-help-brand-banner.png` (new, 900×246) — canonical full banner
  - `static/favicon.ico` (new, multi-resolution 16+32+48 ICO built from owl)
  - `static/apple-touch-icon.png`, `android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`, `mstile-150x150.png` — all regenerated from the owl source so every platform shows a consistent brand mark. Old red-plus-based versions backed up to `.local/favicon-backup-pre-owl/`.
  - `static/images/og-home.png` — replaced. New version is the brand banner composited centered on a 1200×630 black canvas (Twitter/Facebook OG card spec). Every social share now shows the owl + IT+HELP wordmark.
  - `templates/base.html`:
    - Replaced `<link rel="icon" href="/red-plus.ico">` with a proper three-link favicon set: `favicon.ico` (any), `android-chrome-192x192.png` (192×192 PNG), `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180). Existing `manifest.json` already references the android-chrome / mstile files by name, so PWA install also picks up the owl with no further wiring.
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`:
    - Added `.topbar:has(.topbar-nav-toggle-checkbox:checked) { border-bottom-color: transparent; }` inside the `@media (max-width: 768px)` block. When the mobile drawer is open, the topbar's own 1px border-bottom would otherwise leave a faint hairline between two near-identical dark blocks (topbar and drawer) that reads as a visual seam, not an intentional divider. Hiding it lets the two surfaces merge into one continuous panel; the drawer's own border-bottom still terminates the menu cleanly against page content. Uses `:has()` because the checkbox is a descendant of `.topbar`, not a sibling — `~` couldn't reach the parent. Browser support: Safari 15.4+, Chrome 105+, Firefox 121+ (covers >97% of current global usage).
- Why: Owner-provided brand assets needed primary placements where they would actually be seen — every browser tab (favicon), every PWA install (android-chrome / apple-touch), every social share (OG/Twitter card). The in-page IT+HELP wordmark + tagline pill + red-plus glyph treatment (the carefully-tuned brand non-negotiables) is intentionally untouched. The hamburger seam was a real visual quality bug in the mobile drawer.
- Verification:
  - `scripts/check-token-parity.sh`: PASS
  - `zola build`: clean
  - Compiled `index.html` carries all three favicon links + the OG meta tags pointing at the new banner-based image.
  - PurgeCSS dry-run: `:has()` topbar rule survives in `late-overrides.css`.
  - Backup of all overwritten files in `.local/favicon-backup-pre-owl/` so a one-line `cp` reverts the favicon if needed.
- Pending: Mobile spot-check on a real iPhone after deploy to confirm the seam is gone (the drawer should look like one continuous panel from topbar through last menu item). Twitter/LinkedIn/iMessage social-card preview after deploy.
- Rollback: revert this commit; favicons + OG image revert via `cp .local/favicon-backup-pre-owl/* static/` (the old red-plus.ico file is still on disk, just no longer linked).

### 2026-04-17 (a11y · Lighthouse axe fixes — aria-hidden focusable + skip-link contrast)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent)
- Severity: MEDIUM (real Lighthouse failures from production audit; affects screen-reader users + keyboard users)
- Trigger: Owner ran a fresh Lighthouse audit on production and surfaced two failing rules.
- Files:
  - `templates/base.html`:
    - Removed `aria-hidden="true"` from the CSS-only hamburger checkbox `<input id="topbar-nav-toggle">`. axe-core correctly flagged it: the input is keyboard-focusable (Space toggles it) and IS the actual interactive element for screen-reader and keyboard users — it must not be hidden from the a11y tree.
    - Moved `aria-label="Toggle navigation menu"` from the `<label>` to the input. The input now carries the accessible name; the label remains the visual click target wrapping the SVG icon. Sighted/mouse behavior unchanged.
  - `sass/_extra.scss`:
    - Added a hardened `a.skip-link` rule (and `:focus`/`:focus-visible`) using `--neutral-black` on `--brand-blue` (~9:1 contrast, above WCAG AAA). Specificity `a.skip-link` (0,1,1) beats the global `a { color: var(--a1) }` rule (0,0,1) regardless of source order or future cascade additions.
    - Lives in `_extra.scss` (compiled into `abridge.css`) instead of `late-overrides.css` so the rule rides in the most reliably-retained stylesheet through prod PurgeCSS — the original failure mode was that a previous deploy's broken purge glob silently stripped `.skip-link` from `late-overrides.css`, leaving the link to inherit the global blue link color on a non-existent background.
    - Explicit `color`/`background` repeated in the `:focus` block as defense in depth.
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`:
    - Removed the now-duplicated `.skip-link` and `.skip-link:focus` rules; replaced with a comment pointer to `_extra.scss` so the next maintainer doesn't re-add them.
- Why: Two real, failing Lighthouse axe rules from a fresh production audit:
  1. `[aria-hidden="true"] elements contain focusable descendents` on the nav toggle input.
  2. `Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio` on the skip-link.
  Both block WCAG AA conformance and would degrade the Accessibility score.
- Verification:
  - `scripts/check-token-parity.sh`: PASS (no hex literals leaked)
  - `zola build`: clean
  - Compiled `index.html` confirms input renders as `<input aria-label="Toggle navigation menu" class=topbar-nav-toggle-checkbox id=topbar-nav-toggle type=checkbox>` — no aria-hidden present.
  - PurgeCSS dry-run: `a.skip-link` survives in `abridge.css`; Phase-1 print block + reduced-motion still preserved in `late-overrides.css`.
- Pending: Production re-audit after deploy to confirm both axe rules clear.
- Rollback: revert commit `22c5701`.

### 2026-04-17 (Polish · Phase 1 — a11y motion + print stylesheet + form baseline)
- Actor: AI (Replit Agent)
- Severity: LOW (pure additions; only one existing rule modified — extending a selector list in the existing `prefers-reduced-motion` block)
- Scope: First slice of the "make UI amazing, work everywhere" polish program. Architect-reviewed two-phase plan: Phase 1 = compliance + critical fixes (this entry), Phase 2 = visual evolution (sub-page heroes, ultra-wide treatment, CLS fix, "scientific proof" telemetry footer). This entry covers the highest-leverage Phase 1 items with zero brand risk.
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`:
    - Extended the existing `prefers-reduced-motion` block to add `.blob`, `.circuit-bg`, and `.hex-decoration` to the `display: none` selector list. The global `* { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important }` rule in `tokens.css` already neutralizes their motion, but for *purely decorative* elements we hide them outright — a 0.01ms-cycle blur or rotating ring can still produce visible sub-frame jitter on some renderers, which is exactly the kind of low-amplitude motion vestibular-sensitive users react to. Brand identity (IT/HELP wordmark, gold pill, plus, "san diego") is preserved in static form.
    - New `@media print` block at end of file. Hides topbar/hero/nav/footer/all decorative chrome. Adds a small letterhead (`body::before`) on page 1: `IT+HELP san diego  ·  it-help.tech  ·  (619) 853-5008`. Sets paper-friendly typography (11pt body, 12-18pt headings, 1.5 line-height, 0.65in margins). Expands `<a href="http*">` links inline to full URL so the print is useful offline (skips in-page anchors and `mailto:`/`tel:` which are useless on paper). Tables get full borders inheriting `currentColor`, code blocks get a quiet gray background. All colors flow from existing `--bg-*`/`--text-*` tokens which `tokens.css` Layer 5 already remaps to paper colors under `@media print`. **Zero hex literals**, parity gate green.
  - `sass/_extra.scss`:
    - New `FORM-CONTROL BASELINE` block at end. Tokenized styles for `input[type=text|email|tel|url|search|number|password]`, `textarea`, `select`, with `:hover`, `:focus-visible` (brand-blue ring with 2px offset matching the schedule-CTA pattern), `:disabled`, `::placeholder`, `accent-color` for native checkbox/radio, and `<label>`. Site has zero body-level form controls today (DNS Tool is on its own subdomain), so this is forward-compat — the next contact form / signup / search box inherits the brand instead of OS chrome (which renders inconsistently across Safari/Firefox/Chrome on Win/Mac/Linux and breaks dark mode contrast). 44px tap targets, no `-webkit-appearance` hacks needed for Safari.
- Why: Owner asked the agent to "make the UI amazing, work everywhere on every device, perfectly compatible." Architect (consulted before implementation via explore subagent) recommended the two-phase split. Immediate user-visible benefit: printing the rates page now produces a clean leave-behind document instead of a screenshot of the dark website with hidden URLs.
- Verification (local):
  - `scripts/check-token-parity.sh`: PASS (no hex literals leaked into consumer files)
  - `zola build`: clean, 12 pages + 1 section, zero warnings, ~310ms
  - PurgeCSS pipeline (with PR #537's quoted-glob fix now merged to main): `late-overrides.css` survives at 38,071 B (was 24,313 B pre-print-block). Letterhead, hero-wrapper, reduced-motion, and print rules all preserved through purge. Form baseline survives into `abridge.css`.
- Pending: Visual print-output verification on a real printer / browser print dialog (out-of-band; recommend the owner spot-check `Cmd+P` on `/billing/` and a blog post after merge). PR will be `polish/phase-1-a11y-print-forms` against main.
- Rollback: revert this branch's commits — three additions in two files, zero existing rules deleted.

### 2026-04-17 (Hotfix · Revert COEP `require-corp`)
- Actor: AI (incident response)
- Severity: HIGH (production page blank in Safari below the navigation)
- Scope: Roll back the COEP `require-corp` header that Sub-4-bis added in PR #530.
- Files:
  - `infra/cloudfront/csp-policy-v1.json` — removed COEP item, Quantity 4 → 3
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — kept the subresource-check step but reframed it as advisory (it no longer guards a load-bearing security header)
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry
- What broke: Safari rendered the homepage with the top-bar nav visible but everything below the fold blank. Confirmed by user screenshot. Chromium rendered the page correctly, which is why my pre-merge testing missed it.
- Root cause: The CloudFront response-headers policy is attached to the document response only. CSS/JS/image files served from S3 do not carry `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` per-asset. Per the Fetch spec, same-origin responses without CORP should still be allowed under `require-corp`, but WebKit/Safari enforces a stricter interpretation than Chromium for some asset types and silently blocks them, leaving the document with no rendered body content.
- Fix: Remove the COEP header. Keeps the rest of Sub-4 / Sub-4-bis intact (zero-hash CSP, COOP, CORP on the document, the subresource gate script).
- What I should have done before shipping #530: tested the live deploy in Safari, not just Chromium. Adding to the post-deploy checklist below.
- Future re-promotion path (if ever pursued):
  1. First add a CloudFront cache behavior + a second response-headers policy that attaches the same CORP `same-origin` header to all `/css/*`, `/js/*`, `/images/*`, `/fonts/*` paths.
  2. Verify in Safari Tech Preview as well as stable Safari.
  3. Then re-add COEP `require-corp` (or try `credentialless` first, which is more permissive).
- Updated post-deploy QA checklist (additions to the Sub-5 entry below):
  - Open prod homepage in Safari (macOS and iOS) before declaring success on any header change.
- Rollback of this rollback: revert this branch's commits.

### 2026-04-17 (Sub-4-bis · COEP promotion)
- Actor: AI (CSP follow-up)
- Scope: Promote `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` and add a CI gate that prevents future blog posts / template changes from silently breaking it. This is the follow-up the Sub-5 entry below documented as "safe to ship now."
- Files:
  - `infra/cloudfront/csp-policy-v1.json` — added COEP header, Quantity 3 → 4
  - `scripts/check-no-external-subresources.sh` — new CI gate
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — wired the gate in after the asset-copy step, before the CSP-update step
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` — this entry
- Change:
  1. Appended `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` to `csp-policy-v1.json`'s `CustomHeadersConfig.Items`. `require-corp` (not `same-origin`, which is not a valid COEP value — that confusion is with COOP) is the strict variant Mozilla Observatory awards bonus points for. Safe to ship because Sub-5's subresource crawl returned zero external loads.
  2. New CI gate `scripts/check-no-external-subresources.sh` parses every built `*.html` (excluding signature pages on their separate CF behavior) and fails with a clear error if it finds any cross-origin `<script src>`, `<link rel=stylesheet|preload|modulepreload|icon|manifest|mask-icon|apple-touch-icon|prefetch href>`, `<img src>`, `<iframe src>`, `<video src>`, `<audio src>`, `<source src>`, `<embed src>`, or `<object data>`. Verified locally: exits 0 against current `public/`.
  3. Wired into `deploy.yml` as a new step between "Copy images and root files" and the CSP-update steps. Fails closed: if a future change introduces an external embed, the deploy aborts BEFORE the CSP/headers policy is updated, so production stays serving the previous (working) policy.
- Why: One more Observatory bonus (COEP `require-corp` is +5 in the standard scoring), and a permanent safety net so the COEP header can never silently break.
- Confirmed safe by: `update_policy.sh → generate_policy.py` only mutates `SecurityHeadersConfig.ContentSecurityPolicy.ContentSecurityPolicy`. It never touches `CustomHeadersConfig`. The new COEP header therefore survives every future CSP regeneration without special handling.
- Optional future improvement (not in this PR): add a separate workflow job that runs the gate on PR (the current deploy job is gated on `event_name == 'push'`, so PRs only catch this at merge time). The gate is fast (<100ms) so a PR-time run is cheap.
- Rollback: revert this branch's commits, or remove the COEP item from `csp-policy-v1.json` and bump Quantity 4 → 3.

### 2026-04-17
- Actor: AI (Sub-agent 5: Quality-Gate Verification)
- Scope: Final QA gate for the design-transfer/v1 redesign per `.agent-transfer/plans/port-checklist.md` Sub-5. Bookend entry for the redesign work begun in Sub-1.
- Files:
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` (this entry + redesign-v1 scorecard)
  - `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md` (new — consolidated release notes for the redesign)
- Change: Ran the dev-side verification suite that this environment can execute, documented the post-deploy verification procedure for the items that can only be measured against production (Mozilla Observatory rescan, CISA-style external scan, Lighthouse-against-CloudFront), and assembled the redesign scorecard.

#### Dev-side verification PASSED
- `zola build` clean: 12 pages + 1 section, zero errors, zero warnings.
- Token-parity gate (`scripts/check-token-parity.sh`) passes — Sub-2 SOT integrity intact.
- Inline-content audit: **0 inline executable scripts, 0 inline `<style>` blocks** across all 12 site HTML files (signature-page on its separate CloudFront behavior excluded). 15 JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks remain — these are data per W3C CSP §6.6.4.2 and Sub-4's generator filter correctly excludes them from `script-src`.
- Broken-link / dead-asset scan over built `public/`: **0 broken**.
- Visual smoke (desktop, all 5 audited pages): `/`, `/about/`, `/services/`, `/security-policy/`, `/blog/` all render with the new top-bar nav, IT+HELP wordmark logo, and consistent chrome. Hero animation correctly scoped to `/` only (no leakage onto sub-pages — verified by direct inspection of each route).

#### Bonus finding — COEP `require-corp` is now safe to promote
- Sub-4 deferred COEP per the plan caveat that requires a "subresource crawl of every built page proving zero cross-origin loads." That crawl ran here and returned **0 external subresources** across all site pages (script src, img src, link rel=stylesheet/preload/icon, iframe, etc.). The site uses zero CDN-served assets, zero Google Fonts, zero embedded media.
- Recommendation: a follow-up Sub-4-bis PR can add `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: same-origin` (or `require-corp`) to `infra/cloudfront/csp-policy-v1.json` for the documented +5 Observatory bonus. Suggested verification gate is the same shell one-liner used here, wired into the `zola build` CI step so any future blog post adding an embed is caught before deploy.

#### Pending production verification (post Sub-5 merge + deploy)
The following deliverables from `port-checklist.md` Sub-5 require the live CloudFront-served production site (none can be measured against the dev server):
1. **Mozilla Observatory rescan** of `https://www.it-help.tech/` and 3 sub-pages (`/about/`, `/services/`, `/security-policy/`). Target: ≥145. Submit at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/analyze?host=www.it-help.tech.
2. **Lighthouse 100/100/100/100** on the same 5 audited pages, run via Chrome DevTools or `lighthouse https://www.it-help.tech/ --preset=desktop` against the CloudFront-served URLs.
3. **CISA Cyber Hygiene-style external scan**: TLS rating, DNS records, SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment, CAA, MTA-STS — confirm no regression vs the pre-redesign posture (e.g., Hardenize, ImmuniWeb, MX Toolbox).
4. **axe-core a11y audit** against production URLs (browser extension or `@axe-core/cli`). Target: 0 violations on every page.
5. **SRI smoke check**: open prod homepage in Chrome with DevTools → Console open. Expect zero "Failed to find a valid digest" or "Subresource Integrity" violations for `theme-init.js` (Sub-4 added integrity attribute, but dev-server CORS quirks suppress validation locally — only production exercises this code path).
6. **Tag `corp-site-redesign-v1.0.0`** once the five checks above pass. Suggested commit: the merge commit of this PR.

#### Redesign scorecard (Sub-1 → Sub-5)
| Sub-agent | PR  | Status | Key win |
|-----------|----:|--------|---------|
| 1: IA & Content | #525 | merged | 5-section homepage, 6-anchor services, "intelligence brief" tone-of-voice |
| 2: Design Tokens | #526 | merged | tokens.css/SOT, dark-theme baseline, parity CI gate, brand-block extension |
| 3: Templates | #527 | merged | new top-bar nav, IT+HELP wordmark, hero scoped to homepage, footer org-tree |
| 4: CSP Hardening | #528 | merged | CSP collapsed 2KB → 260B, zero hashes, COOP+CORP added |
| 5: QA Gate | (this PR) | in flight | dev-side verification PASS; production rescans documented for post-deploy |

#### Non-negotiables verified (visually)
- Red plus (`#ff0066`) — visible on `/` hero. Untouched. ✓
- IT/HELP outline (`var(--brand-it-help-blue)` gradient) — visible on `/` hero AND in the new top-bar wordmark on every page. ✓
- Math hero animation — `static/js/hero-logo.js` SHA confirmed unchanged across the entire redesign (`git log static/js/hero-logo.js` shows no edits since the redesign began). ✓
- No tracking, no cookies, no JS frameworks — confirmed by external-subresource audit (0 external loads). ✓

- Rollback: revert this branch's commits (`codex/sub5-qa-gate`).

### 2026-04-17
- Actor: AI (Sub-agent 4: CSP Hardening & CloudFront Policy)
- Scope: Push Mozilla Observatory 130 → ≥145 by externalizing the last inline script + style and adding bonus security headers (per `.agent-transfer/plans/csp-tightening-plan.md`).
- Files:
  - `static/js/theme-init.js` (new — extracted theme-flash IIFE from `templates/partials/head.html`)
  - `templates/partials/head.html` (replaced inline `<script>` with same-origin `<script src=... integrity=sha384-... crossorigin=anonymous>` blocking — must run pre-paint; replaced inline `<style>{{critical_css}}</style>` with `<link rel=stylesheet href=css/critical.min.css>`; removed obsolete `noscript` wrapper and the now-unused `load_data` import)
  - `infra/cloudfront/generate_policy.py` (added `NON_EXECUTABLE_TYPE_RE` filter so `<script type="application/ld+json">`, `application/json`, `application/importmap`, and `speculationrules` blocks no longer consume `script-src` allowance — they are data per W3C CSP §6.6.4.2 and were inflating the policy with 15 unnecessary hashes)
  - `infra/cloudfront/csp-policy-v1.json` (regenerated CSP collapses to `default-src 'none'; ...; style-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; ...` — zero hashes, 260 bytes vs ~2KB before; added `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` custom headers)
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md` (this entry)
- Change: Removed every CSP hash from the site policy by externalizing the two remaining inline blocks and teaching the policy generator to ignore non-executable `<script>` types. Added COOP+CORP for the documented +10 Observatory bonus.
- Score delta target: Observatory 130 → ≥145 (+10 from "no inline executable scripts/styles, hash-free policy" + +10 from COOP/CORP). COEP `require-corp` deferred per the plan caveat (requires staging crawl validation of every cross-origin subresource before promotion).
- Verification: `zola build` clean; `python3 infra/cloudfront/generate_policy.py --mode site` reports `0 inline script hashes, 0 inline style hashes, CSP length 260`; programmatic audit of `public/*.html` (excluding the signature page on its separate CloudFront behavior) confirms zero inline executable `<script>` and zero inline `<style>` blocks; live preview renders identically to pre-change.
- Non-negotiables verified: `static/js/hero-logo.js` not modified; Sub-2 token system intact (parity gate passes); Sub-3 chrome unchanged.
- Rollback: revert this branch's commits (`codex/sub4-csp`).

### 2026-02-15
- Actor: AI (Sub-agent 2: Design Token Adoption)
- Scope: Design token adoption (SOT) + token-parity CI gate + dark-theme baseline
- Files:
  - `static/css/tokens.css` (new — verbatim copy of `.agent-transfer/tokens/tokens.css`)
  - `sass/_tokens.scss` (new — verbatim copy of `.agent-transfer/tokens/tokens.scss`)
  - `sass/_extra.scss` (added `@use "tokens" as *;` at top so SCSS variables are available)
  - `templates/partials/head.html` (single `<link>` insertion: `tokens.css` loaded immediately before `late-overrides.css`; head.html is where the `late-overrides.css` link lives, so the one-line stylesheet insertion was made adjacent to it instead of in `base.html`)
  - `scripts/check-token-parity.sh` (new — parses `--*` from `tokens.css` and `$*` from `_tokens.scss`, asserts (name → value) parity, then runs the hex-grep gate over `late-overrides.css` / `_extra.scss` / `abridge.scss`, excluding both SOT files)
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md` (appended Design Tokens section + token table — Sub-agent 1's tone-of-voice section untouched)
- Change: Installed `tokens.css` and `_tokens.scss` as the project SOT. Wired tokens.css into the cascade ahead of `late-overrides.css` so component CSS can consume `var(--*)`. Added `@use "tokens" as *;` to `_extra.scss` so SCSS-side files can also reference token values at compile time. Added the token-parity CI script. Updated `STYLE_GUIDE.md` with the canonical token table. Dark-theme baseline now applied via `tokens.css` `body { background-color: var(--bg-primary); color: var(--text-primary); }`.
- Why: Establish a single, drift-checked source of truth for color/typography/spacing tokens before Sub-agent 3 rebuilds the templates.
- Status / known blocker: Hex audit (Deliverable B) STOPPED per task rule "If a hex has no matching token, STOP and report it in your PR body — do not invent new tokens." The corp-site brand palette currently in `static/css/late-overrides.css` (`--brand-blue`, `--logo-blue-*`, `--schedule-blue-*`, `--schedule-cta-*`, `--accent-gold`, `--accent-gold-solid`, plus the `#ff0066` plus and the `#D2B56F` gold pill stroke) has no equivalents in `tokens.css`, and replacing them with the closest dns-tool tokens (e.g., `--accent-violet` warm copper) would violate the "red plus + IT/HELP outline visually unchanged" non-negotiable. ~104 hex literals therefore remain in the three audited files; `scripts/check-token-parity.sh` exits 1 on the hex-grep gate. Parity check itself passes. Architect decision needed on whether to (a) extend `tokens.css` with a corp-brand block or (b) accept the visual shift to dns-tool tokens.
- Non-negotiables verified: `static/js/hero-logo.js` not modified; red plus and IT/HELP outline rules in `late-overrides.css` not modified.
- Rollback: revert this branch's commits (`codex/sub2-design-tokens`).

### 2026-02-15
- Actor: AI (Sub-agent 1: Information Architecture & Content)
- Scope: IA & content rewrite per design-transfer/v1 (homepage, services, tone-of-voice)
- Files:
  - `content/_index.md`
  - `content/services.md`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
- Change: Rewrote `content/_index.md` body to the 5-section homepage structure from `.agent-transfer/plans/ia-blueprint.md` (hero with new sub-tagline + primary/secondary CTAs, 3-card service teaser, trust-signals strip, "The Method" think-tank paragraph linking to `/blog/` and `dns.it-help.tech`, local credibility block with NAP and phone). Restructured `content/services.md` body into six anchored sections (`#mac`, `#wifi`, `#dns-email`, `#cybersecurity`, `#data-extraction`, `#managed-agent`) with the new `#managed-agent` paragraph framing the $50/device opt-in agent as the explicit anti-managed-services position; refreshed the `ItemList` and `Service` JSON-LD entries to match the new section names and anchors. Appended a new "Tone of Voice" section to `STYLE_GUIDE.md` codifying calm authority, no marketing-speak, specific-over-generic, discretion language, and one-scientific-moment-per-page rules. All existing JSON-LD `<script>` blocks preserved; raw-HTML `cta-button` markup preserved.
- Why: Sub-agent 1 deliverable in the design-transfer/v1 multi-agent port. Locks the structure before Sub-agent 3 rebuilds templates and ensures copy reads at the "intelligence brief" register the architect specified.
- Rollback: revert PR for branch `codex/sub1-ia-content`.

### 2026-02-14
- Actor: AI
- Scope: Deploy reliability hardening (CloudFront invalidation wait robustness)
- Files:
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Change: Replaced `aws cloudfront wait invalidation-completed` with explicit `get-invalidation` polling (90 attempts x 20s = 30 minutes), adding per-attempt status logging and a bounded timeout error message.
- Why: Main-branch deploy failed after merge because CloudFront invalidation exceeded the AWS waiter default timeout ("Max attempts exceeded") even though artifact upload and CSP updates succeeded.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (pending commit hash/PR number).

### 2026-02-14
- Actor: AI
- Scope: Security disclosure hardening + external-link safety refinement
- Files:
  - `content/security-policy.md`
  - `static/.well-known/security.txt`
  - `static/security.txt`
  - `templates/base.html`
- Change: Hardened disclosure operations by adding an authorized-assessment intake checklist, explicit urgent-report handling, and an acknowledgments section in `/security-policy`. Expanded `security.txt` metadata with a secondary policy URL contact and an RFC-compatible `Acknowledgments` field. Updated the Schedule external link rel attributes to `noopener noreferrer`.
- Why: User requested additional cleanup and best-practice refinement from all angles after initial security-policy rollout.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/security-policy-authorized-testing`, `#511`).

### 2026-02-14
- Actor: AI
- Scope: Security disclosure publishing (`/security-policy` + RFC 9116 `security.txt`)
- Files:
  - `content/security-policy.md`
  - `static/.well-known/security.txt`
  - `static/security.txt`
- Change: Added a dedicated non-nav `security-policy` page with coordinated disclosure guidance (contact, safe harbor, scope, response targets, and disclosure expectations), then refined scope language to explicitly allow written-authorized government/contracted testing (including CISA cyber hygiene and approved red-team/social-engineering activity). Published machine-readable contact metadata at both `/.well-known/security.txt` (canonical) and `/security.txt` (compatibility path).
- Why: User requested IT Help Tech security reporting text aligned to existing DNS Tool style, with Red Sift continuing to handle MTA-STS hosting separately, and then clarified that authorized federal/program testing must be explicitly accommodated in policy language.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/security-policy-rfc9116`, `#510`).

### 2026-02-13
- Actor: AI
- Scope: Deploy hygiene (remove stale HTML without affecting active blog output)
- Files:
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Change: Tightened the HTML deploy sync filter to HTML-only (`--exclude "*" --include "*.html"`) and added `--delete` so stale legacy HTML keys are removed from S3 during deploy.
- Why: Post-report remediation found old legacy HTML endpoints persisting in production despite no longer being generated by current builds; this cleanup keeps crawl/index surface aligned with actual site output.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/deploy-html-delete-cleanup`, `#509`).

### 2026-02-13
- Actor: AI
- Scope: Mobile Lighthouse TBT recovery (hero animation workload reduction)
- Files:
  - `static/js/hero-logo.js`
- Change: Deferred constellation startup to idle-time, added touch-device frame throttling, reduced touch-node density, replaced per-call crypto random sampling with pooled random values, and removed per-frame array allocations in link drawing/neighbor selection paths.
- Why: User requested a symbiotic remediation pass to improve mobile Lighthouse performance while keeping Ahrefs/SEO crawl hygiene and preserving the established visual system.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/mobile-tbt-recovery-v1`).

### 2026-02-13
- Actor: AI
- Scope: Ahrefs crawl follow-up (internal redirect-noise reduction)
- Files:
  - `templates/base.html`
- Change: Updated primary nav internal links to explicit trailing-slash URLs (`/services/`, `/billing/`, `/about/`, `/blog/`, `/dns-tool/`) so crawlers hit canonical section URLs directly instead of slashless variants that can produce 3xx hops.
- Why: Post-report remediation pass for the "redirect/HTTP redirect" issue set, focusing on safe, non-visual crawl hygiene improvements.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ahrefs-report-followup-20260213`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: GitHub Actions supply-chain hardening (full SHA pinning)
- Files:
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/dependabot-actions-check.yml`
- Change: Pinned all third-party GitHub Actions in active workflows to full commit SHAs and retained major-version comments so Dependabot can continue updating pinned SHAs automatically.
- Why: User approved the strongest mitigation for workflow action integrity while keeping updates self-maintaining.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Dependabot GitHub Actions self-maintenance + safe auto-merge
- Files:
  - `.github/dependabot.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/dependabot-actions-check.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/dependabot-actions-automerge.yml`
- Change: Added Dependabot configuration for weekly grouped GitHub Actions updates and a two-stage automation flow: a Dependabot-only workflow validation (`zola build`, workflow-file-only scope enforcement) and a follow-up workflow that enables PR auto-merge only after the check workflow succeeds.
- Why: User requested mostly self-maintaining action dependency updates with controlled auto-merge after checks.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Sonar remediation pass (brand-colors + hero RNG hotspot hardening)
- Files:
  - `static/js/brand-colors.js`
  - `static/css/brand-colors.css`
  - `static/js/hero-logo.js`
- Change: Removed deprecated clipboard fallback path and modernized brand-colors script to `let`/`const`, optional chaining, `for-of`, and `globalThis` usage to satisfy Sonar JS rules; strengthened light-theme contrast for chip/code text combinations flagged by Sonar; replaced hero constellation `Math.random()` calls with Web Crypto-backed random sampling (`crypto.getRandomValues`) with deterministic fallback.
- Why: User requested remediation of Sonar issues/hotspots export files and cleanup of actionable findings.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: `/brand-colors` readability + bulk copy controls + sitemap exclusion hardening
- Files:
  - `content/brand-colors.md`
  - `static/css/brand-colors.css`
  - `static/js/brand-colors.js`
  - `templates/sitemap.xml`
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Change: Increased top priority palette chip sizing for readability, added top-level `Copy all HEX` and `Copy all CSS vars` controls, and enhanced brand-color copy interactions. Added a custom sitemap template to skip URLs flagged for noindex and explicitly exclude `/brand-colors/`. Added PurgeCSS safelist entries for copy-state classes used at runtime.
- Why: User requested clearer immediate color visibility, faster bulk handoff tooling, and full search hygiene by keeping the noindex page out of sitemap as well.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: `/brand-colors` immediate palette visibility + robust mini swatch rendering
- Files:
  - `content/brand-colors.md`
  - `static/css/brand-colors.css`
  - `static/js/brand-colors.js`
- Change: Added a top-of-page priority palette strip for the most important colors (blue, logo blue, plus red, gold accent, gold stroke) so brand relationships are visible before scrolling; updated per-card mini swatch generation to reuse existing static `swatch-*` classes for production reliability.
- Why: User requested instant top-level color visibility and confirmed small swatches were not consistently visible in the current render.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: `/brand-colors` compact swatch visibility refinement
- Files:
  - `static/css/brand-colors.css`
  - `static/js/brand-colors.js`
- Change: Converted large card-top swatches into compact accent strips and added small visible swatch chips beside each value code; swatch chips are generated per-card from value/color sources so collaborators can quickly see color relationships without extra vertical bulk.
- Why: User requested small, clearly visible swatches close to the copy controls so color interactions are immediately readable.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: `/brand-colors` layout correction + explicit copy actions
- Files:
  - `content/brand-colors.md`
  - `static/css/brand-colors.css`
  - `static/js/brand-colors.js`
  - `templates/partials/head.html`
- Change: Fixed brand-colors page alignment by overriding Abridge global `section` grid/flex behavior with page-scoped block/grid rules and card sizing resets; added visible per-card copy buttons (token/value) driven by a CSP-safe external script, plus page-level script loading support in head partial via `extra.scripts`.
- Why: User reported misaligned swatch layout and requested obvious copy/paste controls so collaborators can quickly copy token names and color values.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Public brand color swatch reference page (`/brand-colors`) with noindex controls
- Files:
  - `content/brand-colors.md`
  - `static/css/brand-colors.css`
- Change: Added a dedicated, shareable brand color page with canonical swatches, token/value labels, usage notes, and brand rules; attached page-specific styling via external CSS and set page robots meta to `noindex, nofollow`.
- Why: User requested a professional public-facing swatch page for internal/external collaborator handoff that should remain accessible by URL but not indexed in search.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Brand color reference documentation
- Files:
  - `BRAND_COLORS.md`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Added a dedicated brand color reference sheet with swatches, token names, hex/rgba values, usage guidance, and copy-ready brand rules; linked the file from the style guide key-files section.
- Why: User requested a centralized color sheet to improve brand consistency and faster matching across pages.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Schedule CTA token sync + Lighthouse render-blocking hygiene
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Introduced dedicated `--schedule-cta-*` tokens and rewired `.schedule-link` base/hover styles to consume tokens instead of hardcoded hex values. Removed five unused keyframe blocks (`gradient-shift`, `specular-sweep`, `logo-gleam`, `logo-sheen`, `shine`) from render-blocking CSS after Lighthouse insight review.
- Why: User requested final token cleanup and remediation of actionable Lighthouse findings while preserving the approved visual result.

- Scope: IT/HELP anti-purple micro-channel tune (v2)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Applied a smaller RGB channel correction to the logo blues (lower red, slightly higher green) across dark and light logo fills, preserving the same luminance hierarchy while reducing residual violet perception on Apple displays.
- Why: User still observed a subtle purplish cast in top logo edges and requested best-practice final polish rather than major recoloring.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP anti-purple hue correction (Apple-safe)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Rotated the IT/HELP blue ramp a few degrees cooler (same luminance band) and updated light-theme logo fills to match, reducing violet cast while preserving existing gold perimeter, hierarchy, and Safari-safe solid fill rendering.
- Why: User reported the top logo letters still read slightly purplish; objective was true-blue correction without reintroducing risky gradient text techniques.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Hero final optical-weight polish (logo blue depth, schedule restraint, pill centering)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Slightly deepened the IT/HELP blue ramp to reduce top-edge brightness, subdued Schedule CTA highlight/base blues another step so the logo remains the brightest blue element, darkened `san diego` for stronger lockup anchoring, and applied +1px bottom optical padding in the hero pill (desktop/mobile) while keeping the Apple-safe solid text-fill pipeline.
- Why: User requested a best-practice final refinement pass focused on cohesion, hierarchy, and professional finish without introducing rendering risk.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Increased IT/HELP hierarchy by deepening `IT` blue while lifting `HELP`, added subtle depth shaping to the red plus via text-shadow (hue unchanged), darkened `san diego` tone for stronger anchoring, reduced hero pill gold border weight to a restrained thickness, and darkened the Schedule CTA blue one step to keep the logo as the dominant blue element.
- Why: User requested precision feedback on cohesion and asked to tighten visual hierarchy without redesigning the hero identity system.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

### 2026-02-11
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP enterprise hierarchy blue split (IT darker, HELP lighter)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Shifted the logo authority blue ramp to an enterprise profile anchored on `#2F5FAF`, then split lockup hierarchy so `IT` uses the mid token while `HELP` uses the slightly lighter top token in both dark/light theme variants; retained existing gold stroke widths and `P` artifact safeguards.
- Why: User requested a more decisive, cohesive blue direction and provided a preference for `IT` darker with `HELP` subtly lighter while keeping gold perimeter treatment.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-blue-darken-v1`).

- Files:
  - `templates/partials/hero_logo.html`
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Isolated the `P` in `HELP` for per-glyph desktop tuning, then snapped desktop logo sizing/offsets to integer-pixel geometry and reduced `P`-only stroke/halo intensity to suppress the persistent top spur without weakening the mobile wrap.
- Why: User-confirmed top-of-`P` artifact remained on desktop after global perimeter adjustments.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-p-subpixel-clean-v1`).

### 2026-02-10
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP desktop P shoulder spur cleanup
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Added desktop-only (`min-width: 700px`) reductions for IT/HELP gold stroke and halo intensity (dark + light variants) to smooth the top shoulder of `P`, while preserving stronger mobile wrap settings.
- Why: User-reported artifact was visible on desktop at the top of `P` but not on mobile; breakpoint-scoped tuning targets the failing surface directly.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-p-top-spur-fix-v1`).

- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP P contour cleanup (Apple weight + stroke simplification)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Simplified IT/HELP edge treatment to direct gold text-stroke plus downward depth shadows (removed extra gold filter halos), slightly increased stroke width for cleaner full-perimeter read, and removed Apple-specific 800-weight downshift so Safari/iPhone keeps the native heavyweight glyph geometry.
- Why: User still observed dirty/janky rendering around the top of `P`; this pass prioritizes contour cleanliness over effect layering.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-p-solid-clean-v1`).

### 2026-02-10
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP perimeter cleanup (P top-edge smoothing) + blue refinement
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Removed the top-edge micro highlight from IT/HELP shadow stacks, normalized gold stroke widths toward integer values, and rebalanced the gold smoothing/closure shadows so the outline reads more continuous around glyphs without rough `P` shoulder artifacting. Also nudged the logo blue ramp slightly darker for better headline fit.
- Why: User feedback confirmed the top of `P` still looked messy and requested a cleaner full-wrap gold perimeter with a better-fitting blue.

- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Switched IT/HELP stroke rendering to `paint-order: fill stroke` with near-1px gold strokes and a subtle downward gold micro-shadow so the perimeter reads as a complete wrap (including bottom edges). Also nudged logo blue ramp slightly darker for stronger headline presence.
- Why: User feedback showed bottom outline segments were still weak and the interior blue read too light.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-gold-stroke-polish-v1`).

### 2026-02-10
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP gold stroke cleanup and solidity pass
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Increased IT/HELP stroke widths to near-1px values and added a tight gold smoothing halo in text-shadow to reduce jagged edges and make the gold perimeter read as a solid professional border.
- Why: User feedback confirmed the prior gold stroke was visible but still too thin/janky compared to the crisp hero pill border.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-gold-stroke-polish-v1`).

### 2026-02-10
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP explicit gold stroke visibility pass
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Replaced IT/HELP drop-shadow perimeter ring with direct `-webkit-text-stroke` gold outlines (dark + light variants) keyed to `--accent-gold-solid`, while retaining blue fill and depth shadows.
- Why: User reported no visible gold perimeter after repeated ring-shadow passes and requested a clearly solid wrap comparable to the hero pill border.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-explicit-gold-stroke-v1`).

### 2026-02-10

- Change: Removed `background-clip:text` + transparent fill from IT/HELP and switched to solid blue `currentColor` fills with a cleaner, slightly thicker balanced gold perimeter shadow ring. Also brightened logo blue ramp tokens for stronger headline presence.
- Why: User feedback confirmed the `P` top artifact remained visible on both desktop and mobile and the interior blue still read too muted.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-p-artifact-kill-v1`).

### 2026-02-10
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP desktop edge cleanup + blue fill pop pass
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Lifted the logo blue ramp for brighter interior fill, reduced inner contour heaviness, and rebalanced top/bottom gold perimeter ring weights so rounded glyph tops (notably `P`) render cleaner while keeping the thin wraparound gold strip visible.
- Why: User feedback indicated desktop still showed rough artifacts at the top of `P` and the inner blue needed more presence.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-p-smooth-blue-pop-v1`).

### 2026-02-10
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP visible strip layering pass
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Reordered and resized the IT/HELP edge stack so a smaller inner blue contour sits above a larger gold ring (dark and light variants), producing a clearly visible thin gold strip around glyphs while keeping blue fill dominant.
- Why: User feedback remained that gold perimeter was not visible in real Safari/iPhone renderings.

  - `content/dns-tool.md`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Replaced stroke-based logo edge with shadow-based edge treatment to prevent Safari glyph artifacts (notably on `P`), and removed the in-content top-level DNS Tool heading so the template `h1` is the single visible page title.
- Why: Improve rendering reliability and keep SEO/semantic heading structure clean with one `h1` per page.

- Why: Improve color cohesion with the Schedule CTA and preserve a cleaner, more professional blue-first visual system.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-color-cohesion-blue-led`).
- Gold fallback reference: `main@a3b9ea2` (PR `#430`) preserves the current gold-forward logo treatment if we decide to revert to that direction.

  - `sass/css/abridge.scss`
  - `sass/_extra.scss`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Darkened and saturated the shared blue family to a royal-cobalt profile, deepened logo letter shadows for stronger dimensionality, and retuned Schedule/link blues to remain cohesive while reading less “default sky blue.”
- Why: Address user feedback that prior changes looked too subtle and still felt visually generic.

  - `sass/_extra.scss`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Anchored IT/HELP + Schedule + links to DNS Tool’s non-purple blue family (`#58A6FF` anchor), and shifted site dark surfaces from flat black to deep navy-charcoal (`#0D1117` / `#161B22`) for cleaner contrast and less muddiness.
- Why: User requested a non-purple blue outcome and approved background changes if needed to reach a polished final look.

- Scope: Hero panel translucency + icon parity + darker IT/HELP blue + vertical rhythm tune
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `templates/base.html`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Darkened the IT/HELP logo blue ramp one step, made the hero “We solve tech problems” inner panel subtly translucent in dark mode (while preserving high contrast), increased home icon visual size/stroke to better match the sun glyph in the nav control row, and applied a micro-compression to hero spacing (logo block up slightly, `san diego` closer/centered under the mark, tagline/nav stack nudged upward).
- Why: User requested tighter icon parity, improved hero panel depth integration with the moving background, a less “light/boring” IT/HELP blue, and better vertical balance without losing premium whitespace.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/hero-panel-and-icon-balance-v1`).

- Scope: Hero readability/breathing correction pass on PR #445
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Removed blur-prone treatment from the hero tagline panel, increased true dark-mode translucency so constellation particles read through cleanly, removed glow blur from tagline highlight words for sharper legibility, restored breathing space between tagline pill and nav row, and increased mobile `san diego` size/placement for better logo ratio.
- Why: User reported muddy/brown panel tone, blurred highlight words, cramped pill-to-nav spacing, and undersized mobile `san diego`.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/hero-panel-and-icon-balance-v1`), commit `58147f3` as immediate pre-fix reference.

### 2026-02-08

- Scope: Hero control-row geometry + icon modernization
- Files:
  - `templates/base.html`
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Rebuilt the nav pill layout as fixed CSS slots (home/more/schedule/mode) so icon spacing is deterministic without manual text spaces, moved `More` + chevron into the same blue family as Schedule, added a deeper nav-shell treatment, and replaced the old filled home glyph with a cleaner outline house icon.
- Why: User reported spacing fragility and requested a tighter, more modern control row while preserving dark-mode polish and mobile tap ergonomics.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/nav-grid-modern-icon-blue-more`).

- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Hero pill surface cleanup v4 (stroke ring + flat navy interior)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Replaced the gold fill-band ring with a strict 2px gold stroke, removed hover glow/bevel artifacts, and converted the interior from beveled gradient to a flatter translucent navy surface to reduce dirty/tilted edge perception on mobile and desktop.
- Why: User reported the previous pass looked worse and still felt noisy/unclean, especially on iPhone.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/hero-pill-clean-surface-v4`).

### 2026-02-08

- Scope: Hero pill seam removal + Schedule CTA depth polish v5
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Moved the hero pill to a single-surface shell model (outer wrapper owns border+translucent fill, inner text layer is transparent) to eliminate inner-gap/tilt artifacts on desktop/mobile; also deepened and restrained the Schedule CTA gradient, border, and relief so it reads more premium and less toy-like.
- Why: User reported a visible inner gap/outline in the pill and requested a more professional, deeper Schedule button finish.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/hero-pill-and-schedule-polish-v5`).

### 2026-02-08
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Hero pill edge-cleanup pass (remove inner seam artifact)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Removed the inner blue border/inset highlight that created a white seam on iPhone, switched to a cleaner single-surface navy translucent interior, and tightened the gold perimeter into a solid clean ring.
- Why: User reported the hero pill still looked dirty on mobile and not solid on desktop.

- Scope: Hero pill v2 anti-mud pass (true gold stroke + cooler translucency)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Converted hero pill perimeter to an explicit 2px gold border stroke and retuned the interior to a cooler, lighter navy-blue translucent gradient with reduced warm influence, preserving text crispness and particle visibility.
- Why: User reported the previous pill still read muddy/brown on iPhone and requested a clearer blue-translucent interior with a solid gold line.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/hero-pill-cool-blue-v2`).

- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Hero tagline pill de-muddy pass (blue translucency + crisp gold perimeter)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Kept the hero pill gold frame but made it crisper and more stable, then shifted the dark-mode pill interior from warm/muddy tint to a cool navy-blue translucent gradient so constellation/particle motion remains visible while text contrast stays strong.
- Why: User reported brown/muddy pill fill and requested a blue-toned transparent interior with clear background-motion visibility, especially on mobile.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/hero-pill-blue-translucency-v1`).

- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: San Diego lockup de-compression and hierarchy correction
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Lowered `san diego` placement on desktop/mobile to remove the scrunched look under `IT+HELP`, and reduced its luminance/glow so it stays visibly subordinate to the primary logo text.
- Why: User feedback showed the lockup was over-tight and `san diego` was popping too close to body-white levels.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/san-diego-optical-center-v3`), commit `02ef35b` as pre-adjust reference.

### 2026-02-08
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Stronger vertical drop + stronger tonal separation for `san diego`
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
- Change: Dropped `san diego` further away from `IT+HELP` on desktop and mobile (`margin-top` relaxed by ~5-6px) and darkened/desaturated the label/shadow so it no longer reads as the same visual tier as the primary mark.
- Why: User confirmed the lockup still looked too tight and that `san diego` remained too close to the IT/HELP color family.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/san-diego-drop-and-separate-v1`), previous baseline commit `8ceadfa`.

- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
- Change: Unified desktop/mobile `san diego` horizontal nudge and vertical offset to the same lockup logic, then shifted `san diego` to a clearer steel gray-blue tone with softer shadow so it reads as a secondary line rather than the same brand-blue tier as `IT+HELP`.
- Why: User requested matching centering behavior across desktop/mobile and clearer color separation from the IT/HELP logo fill.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/san-diego-center-and-steel-v2`), baseline commit `bbdd35d`.

  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
- Change: Lowered `san diego` by an additional 2px on desktop and mobile (`margin-top: -11px -> -9px`) to add breathing room above the tagline pill while preserving centering and hierarchy tuning from the previous pass.
- Why: User confirmed overall direction but requested a small additional downward move because the logo lockup still felt slightly tight.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/san-diego-micro-drop-v1`), baseline commit `0aa7dac`.

- Scope: Hero stack rhythm rebalance (logo block -> tagline pill -> nav pill)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
- Change: Lowered `san diego` another step (`margin-top: -9px -> -6px` desktop/mobile), increased logo-to-tagline spacing (`.tagline margin-top` desktop/mobile), and increased tagline-to-nav separation (`.nav-wrapper margin-top`) so the lockup reads as three clean tiers without descender collisions.
- Why: User reported the `g` descender in `san diego` still touching/crowding the gold tagline pill and requested full top-down spacing normalization.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/hero-stack-spacing-v1`), baseline commit `5901cf7`.

### 2026-02-08
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: Descender clearance micro-pass (`san diego` to tagline pill)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
- Change: Increased only the `san diego` -> tagline spacing (`.tagline margin-top` +3px on desktop and mobile) to remove remaining visual collision with the `g` descender while leaving color, centering, and nav geometry untouched.
- Why: User confirmed direction but still observed the descender appearing too close to the gold tagline border.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/san-diego-descender-clearance-v1`), baseline commit `b3d6c4c`.

- Change: Added non-negotiable quality philosophy and measurable acceptance gates (Lighthouse, Observatory, security, accessibility, performance, trust/psychology), with explicit "symbiotic best-practices" guidance across all systems.
- Why: Make standards explicit for all AI/dev contributors and prevent "fix later" development drift.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (separate from base palette PR).

### 2026-02-07
- Actor: AI+Developer
- Scope: IT/HELP logo-edge micro-tune (post-merge refinement)
- Files:
  - `static/css/late-overrides.css`
  - `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Change: Applied a small follow-up reduction (about 8-10% from the previous tuned state) to IT/HELP edge and sheen alpha values while preserving thickness/geometry for readability.
- Why: Keep dimensional clarity for older eyes while reducing remaining visual shine/noise.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-logo-edge-micro-tune`).

  - `sass/css/abridge.scss`

- Change: Shifted primary blue/link tokens from cyan-leaning web blue to a deeper indigo-leaning blue system for higher perceived depth and modernity, without adding glow effects or changing logo geometry.
- Why: Reduce "legacy/web-default blue" feel while preserving trust posture and readability.
- Rollback: this branch/PR (`codex/ithelp-indigo-blue-shift`).

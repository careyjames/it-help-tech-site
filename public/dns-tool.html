<h1>DNS Tool üõ†Ô∏è - My Command-Line DNS Auditor</h1>
<p>
Tired of juggling a dozen different web tools and <code>dig</code> commands just to check if a domain's DNS and email security records were <em>actually</em> set up right? <strong>So was I.</strong> That's why I built <strong>DNS Tool</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Why I Built This: The <code>p=none</code> Problem</h3>
<p>
As I always say: <strong>‚ÄúIf your DMARC says <code>p=none</code>, your work‚Äôs not done‚Äîget to <code>p=reject</code>!‚Äù</strong>
</p>
<p>
But getting to <code>p=reject</code> isn't just about DMARC. It means ensuring SPF is aligned, DKIM is signing correctly, DNSSEC is enabled, and MTA-STS is in place. Before DNS Tool, verifying all this meant a tedious dance across countless browser tabs and terminal windows, especially when waiting for DNS propagation. It was inefficient and far too easy to miss something critical.
</p>
<h3>One Tool to Check Them All (The Nerd Brag Part)</h3>
<p>
DNS Tool is my personal command-line solution born from that frustration. It‚Äôs a single, portable binary (thanks to PyInstaller!) that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows ‚Äì no Python install needed on the target system. It's my Swiss Army knife for DNS validation.
</p>
<p>
In one go, it hammers a domain and reports back, with clear ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è symbols, on <em>all</em> the important stuff:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Records:</strong> NS, A, AAAA, MX, TXT, SOA, CAA</li>
<li><strong>Email Security:</strong> SPF (and its lookups!), DMARC (with <code>p=reject</code> nagging!), multiple DKIM selectors, MTA-STS, BIMI</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> DNSSEC validation status</li>
<li><strong>Info:</strong> PTR records and even an RDAP/WHOIS lookup.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It works interactively (with history!) or in batch mode. I use it daily to get a quick, comprehensive picture of a domain's DNS health, verify changes <em>instantly</em> as they propagate, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. It saves me time and gives me confidence that things are <em>really</em> secure and configured correctly.
</p>

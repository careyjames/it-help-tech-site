# IT Help San Diego Inc. Site

This site is a static HTML5 project.

© 2025 IT Help San Diego Inc.

✨ Built with Rust (Zola) & Sass and deployed on AWS. We use only a few lines of JavaScript for essential functionality—no frameworks, trackers, or cookies. Just lean, fast, cost-efficient tech. ✨

## Templates

- Macros in `templates/macros/` are for HTML templates.
- Use shortcodes (`templates/shortcodes/`) for dynamic content inside `.md` pages.

Import first. Then configure. Do not pre-configure anything.

Here’s the exact, correct order — no ambiguity:

On that page (the one in your screenshot)
	1.	Click “Import from GitHub” and complete the import
	•	Repo: careyjames/it-help-tech-site
	•	Public or Private: your call (doesn’t affect Git behavior)
	•	Name is fine as-is
	2.	Let Replit finish creating the Repl
This step does not change your GitHub repo. It just clones it.

At this point:
	•	Replit has a working copy
	•	GitHub is still the source of truth
	•	No one-way trap exists

⸻

After import (this is the important part)

Now you make Replit understand the project.

3. Add replit.nix (runtime definition)
This tells Replit what the project is.

{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.zola
  ];
}

Commit this like normal.

4. Add .replit (how to run it)

run = "zola serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 3000"

Commit this too.

Now Replit:
	•	Can run the site
	•	Can preview changes
	•	Stops whining about “limited agent compatibility”
	•	Still does nothing special to Git unless you tell it to

⸻

How you should actually use it (best practice)
	•	GitHub = authority
	•	Replit = optional editor + preview + AI assist
	•	VS Code = still valid
	•	Codex / Antigravity = still valid

Rules:
	•	Always pull before editing in a different tool
	•	Replit edits → commit → push
	•	VS Code edits → commit → push
	•	Rollbacks = Git (revert / PR / history), not “Replit magic”

⸻

Critical clarity (this answers your fear directly)
	•	Replit does not lock your repo
	•	Replit does not create hidden checkpoints that bypass Git
	•	Replit cannot trap you in a one-way flow unless you stop committing

That yellow box is just saying:

“We don’t know how to autopilot this stack.”

You don’t want autopilot anyway.

⸻

One-line answer

Import first. Then add .replit + replit.nix. Commit. Done.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Mirror Codex’s PR-first workflow inside Replit
	•	Or decide whether Replit is even worth keeping for this repo at all (there’s a very defensible “no” here).

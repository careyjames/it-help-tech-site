### Can you help with PC, Linux, or mixed computer environments?

Absolutely! Our primary expertise lies with **macOS and iOS support**, and we excel at troubleshooting for these platforms, including **secure screen sharing directly with iPhones and iPads**. We also possess a deep understanding of Linux and Windows systems, enabling us to support a diverse range of technical environments effectively.

### How is your service different from a Managed Service Provider (MSP)?

We take a different approach focused on transparency and on-demand support. Unlike many MSPs that lock clients into fixed monthly fees regardless of usage, **we believe you should only pay for IT help when needed.** There are no long-term contracts or arbitrary retainers with us – just fair, transparent billing for actual work performed. Think of it as having an elite IT team on call: we can essentially become part of your team on an as-needed basis. This flexible model saves you money and builds trust. Our goal is to resolve issues efficiently and effectively. We offer high-touch, on-demand IT support as an ethical alternative to the traditional MSP model.

### Do you fix cracked iPhone screens?

**No, we’re not a hardware repair shop.** We specialize in operating systems, software, networking, and data security. For existing clients with a cracked screen, **we offer a concierge replacement:** we pick up a factory-fresh iPhone from Apple, meet you on-site, and migrate your data while you watch. Your phone never leaves your side, so your contacts and sensitive info stay shielded from prying eyes. Prefer a glass replacement? We’ll refer you to a vetted local technician.

### DNS Tool

Source: [https://www.it-help.tech/dns-tool](https://www.it-help.tech/dns-tool)

# DNS Tool - DNS & Email Security Auditor

Tired of juggling a dozen different web tools and `dig` commands just to check if a domain's DNS and email security records were _actually_ set up right? **So was I.** That's why I built **DNS Tool**.

### Why I Built This: The `p=none` Problem

As I always say: **“If your DMARC says `p=none`, your work’s not done—get to `p=reject`!”**

But getting to `p=reject` isn't just about DMARC. It means ensuring SPF is aligned, DKIM is signing correctly, DNSSEC is enabled, and MTA-STS is in place. Before DNS Tool, verifying all this meant a tedious dance across countless browser tabs and terminal windows, especially when waiting for DNS propagation. It was inefficient and far too easy to miss something critical.

### One Tool to Check Them All

DNS Tool is my personal command-line solution born from that frustration. It’s a single, portable binary (thanks to PyInstaller!) that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows – no Python install needed on the target system. It's my Swiss Army knife for DNS validation.

In one go, it hammers a domain and reports back, with clear ✅ ❌ ⚠️ symbols, on _all_ the important stuff:

* **Core Records:** NS, A, AAAA, MX, TXT, SOA, CAA
* **Email Security:** SPF (and its lookups!), DMARC (with `p=reject` nagging!), multiple DKIM selectors, MTA-STS, BIMI
* **Infrastructure:** DNSSEC validation status
* **Info:** PTR records and even an RDAP/WHOIS lookup.

It works interactively (with history!) or in batch mode. I use it daily to get a quick, comprehensive picture of a domain's DNS health, verify changes _instantly_ as they propagate, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. It saves me time and gives me confidence that things are _really_ secure and configured correctly.

### Get The Tool & Full Details

Want to try it out, see the code, or dive into the full details on installation and every command-line flag? It's all open-source and waiting for you on GitHub:
